| The Geometry Service Project (GS) is the internal name for a project under development that aims to restructure the geometry management services within BRL-CAD and provide a new user interface. More specifically, the restructuring aims to leverage an object-oriented design and encapsulate much of the existing functionality in BRL-CAD through three C{pp} interfaces.
|===

'''

=== The Geometry Service consists of three major pieces

* *Geometry Engine*: The Geometry Engine(GE) is a stateless library
built on top of the existing BRL-CAD Libraries: libbu, libbn, libdm,
libged, librt, etc. The GE contains all geometric processing
functions to include Format Converters, Tessilation, and image
processors.

//

* *Geometry Service*: The Geometry Service(GS) is an application
that expands on the functionality of the Geometry Engine (GE) by
adding Multi-user Communications and Session Management, Access
Controls, Multithread capabilities and SVN utilities.

//

* *"New" GUI Project*: Currently nicknamed "G3D", it is a standalone
client that provides visualization of geometry and captures user
input. G3D is designed to be connected to a Geometry Service over
the network via the Geometry Service Network (GSNet) Protocol.

=== Implementation Particulars

* The Geometry Service will be written in C/C{pp} to allow
runtime-extensibility and reuse of code in future projects.
* The Geometry Service leverages the proven and stable functionalities
in BRL-CAD's libraries and binaries.
* The Geometry Service provides an easy to use and extensible network
protocol (GSNet Protocol) for interacting with a running Geometry
Server.
* The Geometry Engine provides a clean and easy to use API for
BRL-CAD's libraries and binaries.
* Each of the three major pieces will be stand-alone products
