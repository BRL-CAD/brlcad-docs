= SED(nged)

== NAME

sed - Places MGED directly into the primitive edit mode.

== SYNOPSIS

*sed* {_path_}

== DESCRIPTION

Places MGED directly into the primitive edit mode. The path must
uniquely identify a primitive shape. If the shape is only referenced
once in the objects being displayed, then the _path_ may simply be the
shape name. If the shape is multiply referenced, then the _path_
should be the full _path_ from a top-level displayed object to the
primitive shape to be edited. The [cmd]*who* command will return a
list of the top-level objects currently being displayed.

== EXAMPLES

The example shows the use of the [cmd]*sed* command to place MGED into
the primitive edit mode for a specified shape.

.Enter the primitive edit mode for a particular shape.
====
[prompt]#mged># [ui]`sed shape1`

Enters the primitive edit state for shape1.
