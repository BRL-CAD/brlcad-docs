== DESCRIPTION

This library exists to permit writing MGED databases from arbitrary
procedures. Some of the high-level structure of MGED databases (e.g.,
that they start with an ID record, and that COMB records must be
followed immediately by MEMBER records) is currently implicit in the
calling routines. This library is by no means complete, and routines
for writing every type of solid do not yet exist. While it is expected
that this library will grow and change as experience is gained, it is
not clear what direction that evolution will take.  Be prepared for
changes in the interface to some of these routines in future
releases. All routines take as their first argument the stdio FILE
pointer (e.g., stdout) on which the generated MGED database record(s)
will be written with fwrite().

_mk_id_ :: fwrites an IDENT record on the indicated stdio file, with
the string _title_ associated.  Note that to have a valid database,
the the first record written must have been an IDENT record such as
written by this routine.

_mk_half_ :: makes a halfspace with name "name".  It is specified by
the distance "d" from the origin, and the outward pointing normal
vector "norm".

_mk_rpp_ :: makes an ARB8 called "name" specified as a right
rectangular parallelepiped in terms of a minimum point "min" and a
maximum point "max".

_mk_wedge_ :: makes a right angular wedge called "name" specified by a
starting vertex located in the lower left corner of the solid, an
x-direction vector, a z-direction vector, an x-length, a y-length, a
z-length, and a top x-length.  The y-direction vector is the result of
x-direction vector cross z-direction vector. All vertices are make in
the counterclockwise direction, bottom face first.  The top face is
made by extruding the bottom face in the z direction.

_mk_arb4_ :: makes an ARB8 called "name" described as an ARB4, i.e.,
by 4 points, the first 3 of which lie on a plane, and the fourth is
the "peak".

_mk_arb8_ :: makes an ARB8 called "name" described by an array of 8
points in "pts". All plates with 4 points must be co-planar. If there
are degeneracies (i.e., all 8 vertices are not distinct), then certain
requirements must be met. If we think of the ARB8 as having a top and
a bottom plate, the first four points listed must lie on one plate,
and the second four points listed must lie on the other plate.

_mk_sph_ :: makes a spherical ellipsoid called "name" centered at
point "center" with radius "radius".

_mk_ell_ :: makes an ellipsoid called "name" centered at point
"center" with three perpendicular radius vectors. The eccentricity of
the ellipsoid is controlled by the relative lengths of the three
radius vectors.

_mk_tgc_ :: makes a truncated general cone called "name" with the base
plate centered at "center" and a height vector "height", which is
perpendicular to the two end plates.  The length of the height vector
defines the location of the top plate.  The vectors "a" and "b" are
the base radius vectors, and the vectors "c" and "d" are the nose
vectors.

_mk_tor_ :: makes a torus called "name" centered at point "center",
with the torus lying in a plane with normal "n". Radius "r1" is the
distance from the center point of the torus to the center of the solid
part, and radius "f2" is the radius of the solid part.

_mk_cone_ :: makes a right circular cone called "name" specified by
the center point of the base, a direction or height vector, a height
scalar, and a radius for each end of the cone. The direction vector is
unitized and serves to derive a vector "a", which is orthogonal to the
direction vector and itself.  This vector is scaled by both radii to
obtain two of four vectors required to make a cone.  It is then
crossed with the unitized direction vector, and the result thereof is
scaled by both radii as well to obtain the last of four vectors needed
to make a cone.

_mk_rcc_ :: makes a truncated general cone (TGC) with name "name"
specified as a right circular cylinder. The base plate of the cylinder
is centered at "base", with height vector "height" which is
perpendicular to the two end plates, the length of which defines the
location of the top plate. The radius given as "radius" defines the
size of the end plates.

_mk_pipe_ :: creates a "pipe" solid with the specified "name" and
writes it to the file "fp".  The user must provide a linked list of
"pipe" segments headed by "headp".  Each pipe segment includes fields
indicating a "control" point for the pipe, an inner diameter, an outer
diameter and a bend radius. The inner diameter must be less than the
outer diameter, and a zero inner diameter creates a solid wire rather
than a hollow pipe.  The pipe is constructed along straight lines
through successive points, with circular bends (of the indicated
radius) connecting the straight sections. The bend radius must be
greater than the outer radius. The user is responsible for freeing the
memory used by the list of pipe segments (see `mk_pipe_free()` below.

_mk_pipe_free_ :: will free the memory used by a linked list of pipe
segments. This does not free the list head.

_mk_pipe_init_ :: initializes a linked list of pipe segments with the
initial point, inside diameter, outside diameter, and bend radius.

_mk_add_pipe_pt_ :: adds another pipe segment to the list with the
indicated point, outside radius, inside radius, and bend radius.

_mk_comb_ :: defines a combination of name "name", with material
properties information included. "len" indicated the number of
_mk_memb_ calls (MEMB records) that will immediately follow. "region"
is a boolean that is set to mark this combination as a
region. "matname" is either a NULL pointer, or a pointer to a string
containing the material property name. "matparm" is either a NULL
pointer, or a pointer to a string containing the material property
parameter information specific to that material. Color is passed as an
array of three unsigned chars in "rgb". Color "inherit" is a boolean,
and if true, the color and material properties will be passed from
upper-level objects to lower-level objects. _mk_fcomb_ makes a simple
combination header, with name "name", length "len", and the boolean
"region".  It functions just like _mk_comb_. "len" _mk_memb_ calls
must immediately follow the call to _mk_comb_ or _mk_fcomb_. Each call
to _mk_memb_ adds a reference to object "name" to the combination. It
is transformed by the 4x4 matrix "mat", and is combined by boolean
operation "op", chosen from the list of: UNION, INTERSECT, SUBTRACT,
from <brlcad/db.h>.

_mk_addmember_ :: is used to obtain dynamic storage for a new wmember
structure (see _wdb.h_ ).  Then _mk_lcomb_ can be used in the same way
as _mk_comb_ to make a combination of a linked list of wmember
structures. This is the only recommended way to create combinations,
because it collects up the details in memory, and produces the
combination and member records all at once, rather than in multiple
calls, as in _mk_comb_ and _mk_memb._ The "op" argument must be one of
WMOP_UNION, WMOP_SUBTRACT, or WMOP_INTERSECT. In the future, _mk_comb_
and _mk_memb_ will no longer be supported. _mk_lfcomb_ is the linked
list equivalent of _mk_fcomb_. Note that the linked list heads must be
initialized by an invocation of BU_LIST_INIT( &head.l );

The routine _mk_bsolid_ writes the header for a b-spline solid "name",
with "nsurf" surfaces, at "res" resolution.  This call must be
followed by "nsurf" calls to _mk_bsurf_ which enters the respective
surfaces into the combination.  This pair work much like the _mk_comb_
and _mk_memb_ pair.

The global variable _mk_version_ may be set to 4 or 5, depending on
which format BRL-CAD database you wish to write. By default, the most
recent version is always created.

== DIAGNOSTICS

None

== BUGS

The library is incomplete. The need for the application to know
higher-level details is unfortunate, but necessary to keep the library
simple. We may pay for this later.
