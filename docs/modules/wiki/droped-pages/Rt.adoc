The rt command is the primary ray-tracer in BRL-CAD. The rt command can
generate a variety of visualizations for a given BRL-CAD geometry
database model depending on the selected lighting model and options
used. The rt command can be invoked both on the command-line and on the
link:mged[mged] command-line and is the default ray-tracer
specified in MGED link:saveview[saveview] scripts and
Tools->Raytrace renderings.
