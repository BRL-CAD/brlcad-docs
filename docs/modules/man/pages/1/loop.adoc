= LOOP(1)

== NAME

loop - generate numerical indices for shell loops, etc.

== SYNOPSIS

*loop* [-c] _start_ _finish_ [_increment_]

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*loop* generates a sequence of numbers between _start_ and
_finish_ inclusive, one per line, on stdout. This is mostly useful for
driving loops when writing Shell programs
xref:man:1/sh.adoc[*sh*(1)]. The default increment is +1 when _start_
< _finish_, and -1 when _start_ > _finish_. An optional _increment_
may be specified. If _increment_ is zero, then the _start_ value will
be generated continuously.

Both floating point and integer arguments can be used.  On integer
arguments, if leading zeros are specified, they will be preserved on
output.  This is useful for generating sequences of file names which
are numbered with leading zeros.

[cmd]*-c* is used for character (char) looping. 

== EXAMPLES

[source,sh]
....
for i in `loop 10 30 5`
do
  echo $i
done
....

will display the values 10, 15, 20, 25, 30 .

[source,sh]
....
for i in `loop 008 005`
do
  echo $i
done
....

will display the values 008, 007, 006, 005 .

[source,sh]
....
for i in `loop 0.1 2.9 0.5`
do
  echo $i
done
....

will display the values 0.1, 0.6, 1.1, 1.6, 2.1, 2.6 .

== BUGS

This program just scratches the surface. The shells could benefit from
a greater ability to perform math. Limitless opportunities for
extensions exist, but this simple version is adequate for most shell
scripts dealing with sequences of images, etc.
