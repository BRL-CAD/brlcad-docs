	editor for the user to modify the combination.
   

== SYNOPSIS

*red* {_combination_}

== DESCRIPTION

Creates a file describing the specified combination and starts an editor for the user to modify the combination. The environment _EDITOR_ 	variable will be used to select the editor. If _EDITOR_ is not set, then__/bin/ed__ will be used. All the attributes of BRL-CAD regions and__combinations__ may be edited in this way. The region-specific attributes 	will be ignored if the _combination_ is not a region and is not set to be a _region_ during editing. It is not necessary to be in an 	editing mode to run this command. The [cmd]*rm, r, comb, c,* and [cmd]*g* commands provide some basic combination editing capabilities.

.Create a file describing a specified combination and edit the combination.
