== Background and Terminology

BRL-CAD is a constructive solid geometry (CSG) modeling system.
Primitive solid shapes are combined using boolean operations to form
regions of homogeneous material.

The database is organized as a _directed acyclic graph_ (DAG), which
is comprised of:

* primitive _solids_ - the minimal elements of the DAG.
* _combinations_ - the non-minimal elements of the DAG, some of which
  are specially marked as regions. The maximal elements of the DAG are
  called tops.
* _arcs_ - containing boolean operators and 4x4 homogeneous
  transformation matrices.

In a slight abuse of terminology, the DAG is often spoken of as a tree
or collection of trees.  In this context, the solids are also called
_leaves_.

=== Format of Data Elements/Database External Format

The external format has several important properties, especially with
regard to the _Object_Body_:

* Numbers are stored in binary for storage efficiency, for speed of
  reading and writing, and for preventing errors from creeping in due
  to repetitive conversion between binary and an ASCII string
  representation. This eliminates the need to use the old g2asc and
  asc2g to move databases between machines of different architectures.
* All data in the object wrapper are stored in a machine-independent
  format, as follows:
+
** All floating point numbers are stored as IEEE double-precision, in
   big-endian order, where byte 0 is on the left end of the word.
** All integers are stored as either _unsigned_ or _twos-complement
   signed_ binary numbers in either 8, 16, 32, or 64 bits, in
   big-endian order.
** All character strings are stored in the ASCII 8-bit
   character set. A string is stored as an integer followed by an
   array of 8-bit characters. The last character in the array is
   always a null byte. The integer indicates the number of bytes in
   the array including the terminating null.


== Definition of a Single, Generic Database Object

The database access library stores _objects_ as a collection of data
with a globally unique name and places no interpretation on the
content of those data.  The _object_ is the smallest granularity of an
item in the database; objects must be read from and written to the
database in a single atomic operation.

In the case of librt, each database object will contain exactly one
combination node or leaf (solid) node.

=== Object Structure

All objects share certain common properties, which are stored in a
standardized _object wrapper_ consisting of an Object Header and an
Object Footer.

The Object Header consists of: 

* An 8-bit Magic1 element that holds a specific magic number value
  used for database integrity checking.
* A 16-bit Flags element consisting of three 8-bit fields: HFlags,
  AFlags, and BFlags, described later.
* A 16-bit Object_Type element organized into two 8-bit-wide fields:
  the Major_Type and the Minor_Type.
* An Object_Length element that indicates the total number of bytes
  required for this object, including the magic numbers.
* An Object_Name element that is a string holding a name unique to
  that object and drawn from a name space that is global to the
  database. Like other strings, it consists of two fields, Length and
  Data. In the case of the Object_Name element, these are referred to
  as Name_Length and Name_Data, respectively. Note: The Object_Name
  element is mandatory for all allocated storage in the
  database. Database free-space management objects are the only
  objects for which the Object_Name element is optional.

The Object Footer consists of: 

* Any padding bytes necessary to bring the total size of the object in
  bytes to an integral multiple of 8.
* An 8-bit Magic2 element that holds a specific magic number value
  used for database integrity checking.

Objects may store application-specific information in an Object
Interior.

* An object may optionally have an Object_Attributes element
  consisting of a pair of fields: Attribute_Length and
  Attribute_Data. From the point of view of the database interface
  specification, the names and values of these attributes are opaque
  (but a standardized import and export encoding API is provided).
* An object may optionally have an Object_Body element consisting of a
  pair of fields, Body_Length and Body_Data. From the point of view of
  the database interface specification, the format of the data is
  opaque.

Note that an object can now have (1) either an attribute or a body,
(2) both an attribute and a body, or (3) neither an attribute nor a
body.

The on-disk version of each object consists of three distinct parts:
Object Header, Object Interior, and Object Footer.  This is called the
external format of the object.

The routines rt_db_get_internal() and rt_db_put_internal() are used to
move objects between their format in the database disk file and their
internal format in memory.  The routines are defined in `librt`.)

=== Flags

The Flags element consists of three 8-bit fields: HFlags, AFlags, and
BFlags.  The HFlags field is 1 byte containing flag bits that pertain
to the noncompressible basic header and the database object as a
whole.  The AFlags and BFlags fields are each single bytes containing
flag bits that pertain to the (potentially compressed) attributes and
body, respectively, in the object interior.

[[_wid_flags]]
==== Wid Flags

The length of an object or sub-element in the database is recorded
using an unsigned integer.  These are variable-width fields based on
the magnitude of the maximum number needed.  The Wid bits specify the
size of the unsigned integer employed in each instance.  There are
four 2-bit width (Wid) flags: Object_Wid (OWid) and Name_Wid (NWid)
(stored in HFlags), Attribute_Wid (AWid) (stored in AFlags), and
Body_Wid (BWid) (stored in BFlags). The Wid fields are interpreted in
this manner:

|===
| Wid Bits
| Width (in bits) of Associated Length Fields

|00
|8

|01
|16

|10
|32

|11
|64
|===

The OWid flag, at the high end of HFlags, encodes the width of the
Object_Length field.  The NWid flag, in bits 3 and 4 of HFlags,
encodes the width of the Name_Length field (when the name element is
present; see the N bit, shown later). AWid (or BWid, as the case may
be) encodes the width of the Attribute_Length field (when the
Object_Attributes or Object_Body element is present; see the AP and BP
bits below).

(See the original draft at
[http://ftp.arl.mil/~mike/papers/brlcad5.0/newdb.html].)

The rationale for allowing the width of the Object_Length field to be
specified independently of the other widths is to save space on
objects in which the values in many of the length fields nearly
overflow the specified field width, so that their sum requires a wider
field.  For example, for four 255-byte interior fields, the
corresponding length fields need be no more than 8 bits wide, so the
choice Interior_Wid=00 suffices, but their combined length of 1020
bytes would require Object_Wid=01.  Because all of the length fields
besides Object_Length must have the same width (FIXME: is that true?),
the largest of the values stored in these length fields determines the
value of Interior_Wid required.  Both Object_Wid and Interior_Wid may
vary from object to object.  It is expected that the routines that
write an object to the disk will use the narrowest width possible for
each object.

[[_r_bits]]
==== "r" Bits

The bits labeled as "r" in all three flags are reserved for future
design work assigning additional optional fields in the object.

==== HFlags - the DLI Flag

The DLI flag is a 2-bit flag that indicates whether the object is an
Application Data Object or a Database Layer Internal Object.  The bits
are interpreted as follows:

.DLI Flag Structure
[cols="^,~a", frame="all", options="header"]
|===
| [nowrap]#DLI Bits#
| Meaning

|00
| Application Data Object

The object contains application-specific data.  N must be 1.  A and B
are determined by what the application presents for storage in the
object; both may be 0 (empty Object_Interior).

|01
| Database Layer Internal, Header Object

A Header Object must be the first object encountered in the database.
In order to support direct concatenation of two existing databases
into one new database, additional header objects may appear elsewhere
in the database The header object has no object name, object
attributes, or object body (e.g., NP=0, AP=0,
BP=0). Major_Type=RESERVED, Minor_Type=0.

|10
| Database Layer Internal, Free Storage.

Unused space in the database is kept using a special Free DB Storage
object that has no object name or object attributes.  The object body
is null-filled and of the proper size for the storage to be
represented.  Like all other objects, the total length of the object
will be a multiple of 8 bytes.  NP=0, AP=0, BP=1.
Major_Type=RESERVED, Minor_Type=0.

|11
| Database Layer Internal, Reserved

This value is reserved for future use. 
|===

The DLI flag is not available to the higher database access layers.

[NOTE]
====
Implementation note: Before writing a new object into the database in
a free area, the library should read the object header from the
database and confirm that the space is indeed free.  Similarly,
additions to the end should be checked by ensuring that the file
hasn't been extended.  In case the check fails, the database write
should fail, the user should be notified, and the internal library
mode (not the operating system file access permissions) should be
changed over to read-only access so that no further attempts to write
will be issued.  These checks will provide protection against two or
more users trying to modify the same database simultaneously and
accidentally stepping on each other.  In the NFS world, file locking
isn't a strong enough assurance.
====

==== HFlags - the NP Bit

The "NP" bit indicates whether the Name element (consisting of
Name_Length and Object_Name fields) is present (1) or absent (0) in
the noncompressible basic header immediately following the
Object_Length field.  The width of the Name_Length field is specified
by the Name_Wid field.

==== AFlags/BFlags - the AP/BP Bit

The "(A|B)P" bit indicates whether the Attributes (or, alternatively,
Body) element consisting of Attribute_Length and Attribute_Data (or
Body_Length and Body_Data) fields, is present (1) or absent (0) in the
Object_Interior.

==== AFlags/BFlags - the AZ/BZ Flag

The 3-bit "(A|B)Z" flag indicates the compression, if any, of the
object Attributes (or Body):

database for their own particular purposes far beyond what the
"attribute" method permits.

[[_major_type]]

Major Type 0 is illegal.  The rationale is to provide the library an
opportunity to detect incompletely filled in data structures.

The details of these Minor_Types are provided in Section IV. 

==== Major_Type = 3: Attribute-Only Objects

This type of object stores only attributes in the object interior
section; it has no object body elements.

For example, if several objects need to have the same shader
parameters, it would be possible to create one attribute-only object
to hold these common attributes and serve as a simple form of
"macro". Objects that needed to share these attributes could all
reference the same attribute object.  If the attribute object is
altered, then all of the objects that reference it would be updated
together.  Without this capability, the user would have to update each
element individually to alter the attributes.

Conventions will have to be established regarding which attributes of
an attribute-only object will be used when a macro reference is
performed.  For example, rt shaders will only be interested in the
value of the "oshader=" attribute, while librt's tree-walker might
also be interested in the "rgb=", "giftmater=", "nsn=", "material=",
and "los=" attributes (assuming that a convention was developed so
that a combination could macro-reference an attribute-only object
too).

An attribute-only object may not have an object body; thus, flag bit B
must always be zero for this type of object.

As used by the rt family of applications codes, these attribute-only
objects will contain "macros" for shaders.  The shader name and its
parameters shall be encoded as a single ASCII string, which is the
value of the "oshader=" attribute.  An rt shader named "macro" (or
equivalent) would take a single parameter "obj=", which would specify
the name of the attribute-only object in the database from which the
actual shader and shader parameter information would be extracted.

There will be one attribute-only object with a reserved object name of
"_GLOBAL" that will be used to contain various kinds of states that
are global to the entire ".g" database and that had previously been
found in the database header itself.  There will be the following
BRL-CAD-specific attributes whose meaning is predefined for the
_GLOBAL object:

* title = The database "title" string previously found in the database
  header.
* units = The most recent editing units, specified as an ASCII string
  with a floating point conversion factor. For example, the conversion
  factor for inches to millimeters would be 25.4.
* regionid_colortable = A string that contains a collection of all the
  information previously found in "struct material_rec ID_MATERIAL"
  records. Exact encoding yet to be determined; it's a collection of
  integer 5-tuples of the form: {low, high, r, g, b}.

In addition, the "comment=" attribute of the "_GLOBAL" object may be
used to store human-readable remarks about the database that are not
more properly associated with a specific database item.  These might
include remarks about data sources, model evolution, security
classification, and release restrictions.  In the absence of some
outboard revision-control system, this might also be a place to record
modification history, although such use is discouraged.

[[_bulk_binary_objects]]
==== Bulk Binary Objects (Major_Types 8-31)

This class of objects contains various "bulk" binary data that might
otherwise have been placed in auxiliary files.

MGED and stand-alone commands must be built to store/extract these
opaque binary objects between a ".g" file and other files.  A user
might want to use those same MGED commands to store or extract the
binary object body of any object for external processing.  An easy
example to imagine is the importing and exporting of texture maps for
external processing, but the same commands could be used for importing
and exporting solid parameters in their external binary form.

These objects may be referenced in combination nodes, for
organizational purposes, but they cannot be drawn in MGED or
raytraced, and doing so would result in a warning message being
printed by the tree walker as that arc is traversed.  This class may
be used by all applications and layers.

The data's purpose may be placed in the "purpose=" attribute.
(????????Need a table/registry of presently known values for this
attribute.)

Routines that retrieve bulk binary objects should check the minor type
and the "purpose=" attribute and send a warning message in the event
of a mismatch, but best-effort processing of the object should
continue.  This will permit some degree of error checking, which
should benefit novice users without standing in the way of
"creatively" reusing one set of data, (e.g., using one array of values
as both a height field and a bwtexture). This allows common data
perversion practices, such as interpreting an array of floats as an
array of bytes, to continue.

Each application will need to have its own syntax for the user to
specify whether the data source is an outboard file or a raw-binary
object.  For example, the current RT sh_texture module uses the
keyword file="name" to indicate an outboard file; that might be
supplemented with an additional obj="name" possibility for retrieving
from an inboard raw-binary object.

Major_Type = 8: Experimental Binary Objects :: This class of objects
contains bulk binary data and is intended for experimental use by
applications developers.  Each time a database containing objects of
this type is opened, BRL-CAD will issue a user-visible warning.
Production software and databases should not use these objects.
Developers should obtain registered 16-bit object types from the
website in order to avoid collisions with other applications.

Major_Type = 9: Uniform Array Binary Objects ::
+
--
This class of objects contain various "bulk" binary data that might
otherwise have been placed in an auxiliary file.

Point of Discussion?????Has ramifications... we have to implement type
advising, so that applications that use these data can compare the
type provided in the minor type code with the type that they're
expecting and advise the user (with a warning message) that there is a
potential type mismatch.

The "S" bit indicates whether an integer type is signed (1) or unsigned (0). Floats and doubles (i.e., atomic types with the highest atom bit equal to 0) are explicitly signed, so they will have the "S" bit equal to 1.
(The bit patterns corresponding to unsigned floats and doubles are reserved for possible other use.) 

The 2-bit "Wid" flag specifies the length (in atomic elements) of the array elements:

As examples, data in PIX(5) format, which might be used for a texture
map, would have Minor_Type "0010 0100", indicating a triple of
unsigned char, and CMYK data might be stored with Minor_Type "0011
1011", indicating a quadruple of doubles.

etc.) may be placed in the "purpose=" attribute.  ????? Point of

Major_Type = 10: MIME-Typed Binary Objects :: This class of objects
contains data, the format of which is specified in the attribute
"mime_type". The Minor_Type of these objects should always be zero.

Major_Type = 16-31: Registered-Type Binary Objects :: This class of
objects contains application-specific bulk binary data and is intended

==== Major_Type = 255: Database Layer Internal Objects

A Minor_Type of 1 indicates that this is a contiguous block of free
storage.

A Minor_Type of 2 indicates that this is a database header. 

=== Object Length

The Object Length specifies the number of 8-byte chunks used to store
an object.  This includes all bytes from Magic1 through Magic2,
inclusive.

=== Object Name

The Object_Name element is a string that holds a name unique to that
object and drawn from a name space that is global to the database.
The Object_Name element is mandatory for all allocated storage in the
database.  Database free-space management objects are the only objects
for which the Object_Name element is optional.

The name is specified in 8-bit ASCII.  There is no support for
UNICODE.  The name is null-terminated, and the null byte is included
in Name_Length.

See the section on DLI flags.  In the case of Free objects, the name
is not retained.  Undeleted objects have a different DLI flag code.

=== Object Attributes

An object may optionally have an Object_Attributes element which
stores an association list (key=value) binding attributes to values:

....
aname1=value1, aname2=value2, ..., anameN=valueN
....

The keys are ASCII strings of unlimited length.  These attributes are
intended for direct use by programs.  There will be a WWW registry of
attribute names presently in use to prevent two application developers
from using the same attribute name for different purposes.

For attribute names and ASCII attribute values, The decision was taken
to support 8-bit ASCII only.  The on-disk encoding of this will simply
be:

....
aname1 NULL value1 NULL ... anameN NULL valueN NULL NULL
....

where NULL represents a byte with all bits zero.
The NULL in place of anameN+1 signals the end of the ASCII attribute data. 

PROPOSED: A second type of attribute has an ASCII key but a binary
value. Such attributes follow the ASCII-valued ones after the double
NULLs:

....
anameN+1 NULL uintN <uintN binary bytes> [...0 or more binary attribute pairs]
....

where, for each binary attribute pair, the uintN is of size AWid and
is the length of the binary value for its ASCII key.

Every object in the database may have zero or more attributes attached
to it; the meaning of these attributes will vary depending on which
application or library processes them.

There are several aname conventions that all BRL-CAD applications are
expected to respect.  There will be a WWW extendable registry of
"in-use" anames, so that independent applications developers may
select aname strings for their own use without fear of name conflicts
later.  The initial registry would include:

* comment = Every object may optionally have a comment that contains a
  string of an arbitrary number of newline-terminated lines of
  text. These are strings for use by humans only. None of the BRL-CAD
  software may parse or interpret these strings other than to print
  them and edit them when requested by the user. They are provided for
  the modeler to place notes in.
* nsn = The American National Stock Number (NSN) for this part, when
  known.
* material = The format of this string is not currently defined as
  there are conflicting naming/coding conventions employed by the
  various standards organizations (e.g., ISO, ASME, etc.).
* region = For combinations, indicates this combination is a
  region. Boolean.
* inherit = For combinations, indicates whether attributes from lower
  combinations in tree will replace higher ones. Boolean, default=0.
* oshader = For combinations, read by the "rt" program, optical shader
  name and parameter string (separated from each other by white
  space). Meaningful only at or above a region node, and only on a
  combination, or in an attribute-only "macro".
* rgb = For combinations, when present indicates optical rgb color is
  specified.
* region_id = For regions, GIFT compatibility. Integer.
* giftmater = For regions, GIFT compatibility. Integer. (Point of
  Discussion?????Should we use negative values for air codes, positive
  for non-air, so we can eliminate air codes?)
* aircode = For regions, air code. Integer. 0 is the same as attribute
  not specified. (Point of Discussion?????Possibly eliminated in favor
  of negative giftmater values).
* los = For regions, GIFT compatibility. Integer.
* component = For regions, the name of the MUVES component containing
  this object.
* rlist = The proposed BRL-CAD "replacement list" field would be
  stored on a binary-block attribute ("rlist="). [deferred
  implementation]
* macro = If present, specifies name of an attribute-only object to be
  consulted for additional attribute values.

All other attributes, from whatever source, would be stored similarly,
including application-specific and end-user-created attributes.

=== Object Body

The contents of the Object Body are opaque?? to the database layer.
The contents of this element are interpreted based upon the
Object_Type.  The Object_Body is not constrained to start on a chunk
boundary.

=== Padding and Length Rounding

The minimal object is a Free object (with no name) 8 bytes long: 

....
Magic1 (1 byte)
HFlags = 000xxxxx (1 byte)
AFlags = 0000xx00 (1 byte)
BFlags = 0000xx00 (1 byte)
ObjType = Free (2 bytes)
ObjLen = 8 (1 byte)
Magic2 (1 byte)
....

This is why we have chosen the 8-bit size for our chunks.  Pad bytes
are inserted as necessary in the Object Footer immediately before the
second magic number so that the final byte of the object is the Magic2
byte.  The pad bytes are not counted as part of the Body_Length, but
are counted as part of the Object_Length.

The minimal valid object is thus the following Free object: 

....
Magic1 (1 byte)
HFlags = 00000x10 (1 byte), OWid=00, NP=0, NWid=00, DLI=10
AFlags = 000xx000 (1 byte), AWid=00, AP=0, AZ=000
BFlags = 000xx000 (1 byte), BWid=00, BP=0, BZ=000
Object_Type = RESERVED (2 bytes)
Object_Length = 8 (1 byte)
Magic2 (1 byte)
....

The header of the database will always look like this: 

....
Magic1 (1 byte)
HFlags = 000xxx01 (1 byte), HWid=00, NP=0, DLI=01
AFlags = 00000000 (1 byte), AWid=00, AP=0, AZ=000
BFlags = 00000000 (1 byte), BWid=00, BP=0, BZ=000
Object_Type = RESERVED (2 bytes)
Object_Length = 8 (1 byte)
Magic2 (1 byte)
....

The hex and ASCII dump of this object would look something this:

....
76 01 00 00 00 01 00 35 |v......5|
....

The minimal valid allocated database storage object (with an
Object_Name, no Object_Attributes or Object_Body) would thus be:

....
Magic1 (1 byte)
HFlags = 00100x00 (1 byte), OWid=00, NP=1, NWid=00, DLI=00
AFlags = 000xx000 (1 byte), AWid=00, AP=0, AZ=000
BFlags = 000xx000 (1 byte), BWid=00, BP=0, BZ=000
Object_Type = OPAQUE?????_BINARY (2 bytes)
Object_Length = 16 (1 byte)
Name_Length = 2 (1 byte)
Object Name (1 character + null byte) (2 bytes)
Pad (5 bytes)
Magic2 (1 byte)
....

Without the padding, that (rather useless) object would be 11 bytes
long.  Given the rounding requirements, it is clear that all allocated
storage objects in the database must be at least 16 bytes long.  A
database object with a minimal Object_Body would need 12 bytes, which
would need to be padded out to 16 bytes as well:

....
Magic1 (1 byte)
HFlags = 001xxxxx (1 byte)
?? correctly xfer these data to A/B flags: IFlags???? = 00x1xxxx (1 byte)
AFlags = 00000000 (1 byte), AWid=00, AP=0, AZ=000
BFlags = 00000000 (1 byte), BWid=00, BP=0, BZ=000
Object Type (2 bytes)
Object Length = 16 (1 byte)
Name Length = 2 (1 byte)
Object Name (1 character + null byte) (2 bytes)
Body Length = 1 (1 byte)
Body Data (1 byte)
Pad (4 bytes)
Magic2 (1 byte)
....
