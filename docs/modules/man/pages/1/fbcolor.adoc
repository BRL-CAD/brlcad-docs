== NAME

fbcolor - interactively pick colors

== SYNOPSIS

*fbcolor* [-F _framebuffer_] [-s|S _screen_squaresize_] [-w|W _screen_width_] [-n|N _screen_height_]

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*fbcolor* is an interactive color picking facility. It allows you
to pick and display colors, by varying parameters in either RGB (red,
green, blue) or HSI (hue, saturation, intensity) space.

*-F* _framebuffer_ :: This option specifies which framebuffer the
image is to be saved from.  If not given, the environment variable
_FB_FILE_ is used to select the display device (see
xref:man:1/brlcad.adoc[*brlcad*(1)]).  If _FB_FILE_ has not been set,
the default device for your system will be used.

The [opt]*-SWN* (or [opt]*-swn*) options can all be used in the normal
way to specify the size of the screen (see
xref:man:1/brlcad.adoc[*brlcad*(1)]).

[cmd]*fbcolor* draws a set of color bars in the lower left corner of
the display, sets the remainder of the display to the current color,
then starts reading standard input for color editing commands. As you
change the various parameters which specify the color, the color bars
grow and shrink to show the relative red, green and blue intensities.

At the same time, [cmd]*fbcolor* displays the current RGB and HSI
values on your terminal.  This allows you to record the RGB or HSI
values of the colors you select for later use.

[cmd]*fbcolor* recognizes two main sets of commands; those which
select which parameter to edit, and those which vary the value of the
selected parameter. *r*, *g*, and *b* selects the red, green, or blue
color for editing, while *h*, *s*, and *i*, (or *v*) selects the hue,
saturation, or intensity for editing. There is one other parameter
selection character, the */*, which steps through the list of color
parameters in the order given above.

*+* and *$$.$$* both increment the currently selected parameter by
one; *-* and *,* both decrement by one, and *>* and *<* increments and
decrements by 16. The value of each of the parameters can range from 0
to 255 and all parameters wrap in both directions.

A *?* prints a short command summary, and typing *q*, *Q*, *<CR>*, or
*<LF>* exits the program.
