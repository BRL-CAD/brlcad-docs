.SH "NAME"
fb\-png \- save a framebuffer image in a color Portable Network Graphics (PNG) file

\fBfb\-png\fP [\-ic] [\-# \fInbytes/pixel\fP] [\-g \fIgamma\fP] [\-F \fIframebuffer\fP] [\-s \fIsquaresize\fP] [\-w \fIwidth\fP] [\-n \fIheight\fP] [\fIfile.png\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBfb\-png\fP will take a region of a framebuffer display and save it
as a color \fIpng\fP format file. The environment variable \f(CRFB_FILE\fP
is used to select the display device (see
\fBbrlcad\fP(1)). If this variable is not set, the
default device for your system will be used. Alternatively, the
framebuffer may be explicitly specified by using the \fB\-F\fP flag.
.sp
By default, the output \fIpng\fP file, and the requested framebuffer size,
is assumed to be 512x512 pixels. The \fB\-s\fP flag will set both the
file height and width to be the given size, while \fB\-w\fP and
\fB\-n\fP are used for setting them individually.
.sp
A first quadrant coordinate system is used (origin in lower left of
screen), and the area saved is normally from this origin. The
\fB\-i\fP flag switches to a fourth quadrant system, both in the
storage order as well as the origin offset coordinates (i.e. origin is
now the upper left corner of the screen).
.sp
The \fB\-#\fP \fInbytes/pixel\fP flag specifies the number of bytes
per pixel.  The only values accepted are 1 and 3.
.sp
The \fB\-c\fP flag specifies that the color map in the frame buffer
should be applied to the pixel values (crunched) before they are
written to the output file.
.sp
The \fB\-g\fP \fIgamma\fP flag sets the specified gamma correction
value into the created PNG file.  A value of 0.6 is a close
approximation of PC display monitors. A negative gamma value disables
writing a gAMA chunk out entirely (and is the default).
