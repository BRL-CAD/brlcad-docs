= Using the build_region Command
:sectnums:

Just as the Build Pattern tool can help automate the process of
building multiple occurrences of objects, the [cmd]#build_region#
command can help automate the process of creating regions.  The
command (which currently has no graphical user interface equivalent)
uses meaning assigned by the user in the primitive name based on the
intended use of the primitive.

The user includes the Boolean operation and relational information in
the name of the primitive using a simple naming convention.  The
naming convention is designed around the following two assumptions:

* The same text "tag" is used for all primitives in a region.
* A sequential numbering pattern is used.

For example, let's say we want to build the four rounded corners of a
"tub" region for a toy metal wagon assembly (see Figure 1). We could
choose something such as "wgn" -- an abbreviated form of "wagon" -- as
the tag.  This tag is short, easy to type, and representative of the
final assembly name.  Our primitives would therefore be of the form
*wgn.s#*.

Next, we create an arb8 for one long side of the wagon tub.  It is
named wgn.s1.  After that, we create an rcc for one corner of the tub.
It is named wgn.s2.  To get a hollow quarter cylinder, we need to
subtract a cylinder and intersect a bounding box (see Figure 2). In
order to relate the subtraction and intersecting primitives with
wgn.s2, they will each share the same root name, wgn.s2.  The
subtraction primitive will be named wgn.s2-1, and the intersecting
primitive will be named wgn.s2+1.

Now we have created the following four primitives: 

....
wgn.s1 wgn.s2 wgn.s2+1 wgn.s2-1
....

If we separate the primitives sequentially as follows,

....
wgn.s1
wgn.s2 wgn.s2+1 wgn.s2-1,
....

we can begin to see the Boolean structure falling out of the naming
convention

....
u wgn.s1
u wgn.s2 + wgn.s2+1 - wgn.s2-1
....

If we wanted to make a second subtraction from wgn.s2 -- say, for a
drain hole in the corner of the wagon -- we would name that primitive
wgn.s2-2 (see Figure 3). We can break this name down as follows:

*NEED IMAGE HERE*

Note that the root name stays the same so we can maintain the
relationship, and the second number (associated with the Boolean
operation) is incremented sequentially.

Obviously, the overall success or failure of the build_region command
depends on primitives being named properly.  But if they are, the
command can organize them in one automated step, creating complex
regions in just a few keystrokes.

Another modeling benefit of the build_region tool is that it allows
the user to quickly organize primitives.  Assume, for example, that we
have used the aforementioned naming convention to construct a
complicated region.  If there was a subsection of the region that we
needed to, say, keep out for another assembly, delete from our
database, move slightly, or copy, it would be a simple matter to
create a new region with just those primitives that we needed.
