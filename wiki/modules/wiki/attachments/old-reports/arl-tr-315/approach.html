<TITLE>IGES 4.0 to BRL-CAD Translator for CSG Models</TITLE>
<H2>IGES TO BRL-CAD APPROACH</H2>


Most of the CSG entities in IGES can be directly converted to 
a corresponding object in 
<EM>BRL-CAD</EM> however, there are a few exceptions.  The block and the 
right angular wedges convert directly to the <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> <EM>genarb8</EM> 
solid.  The right circular cylinder and right circular cone frustum 
entities convert directly to the <EM>gentgc</EM> solid; the 
sphere and ellipsoid entities convert to the genell 
solid; and, of course, the torus entity converts directly to the <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> 
tor solid.  The solid instance entity is implemented by simply 
creating another copy of the instanced solid in the <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> model.<P>

The solid of linear extrusionone of the exceptions noted 
aboveis not currently a supported primitive in <EM>BRL-CAD</EM>, so we 
approximate it by using a combination of other <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> primitives.  
In cases where the curve to be extruded is simply a single circular 
or conic arc, then a <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> <EM>gentgc</EM> solid is produced.  
If the curve to be extruded is anything else, we approximate the curve 
by a series of straight line segments and a <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> polysolid 
is built.  The sides are all polygons of four vertices and the top 
and bottom surfaces are simply additional polygons to close the ends.<P>

The solid of revolution is also implemented by approximating 
the defining curve as a series of straight line segments.  When the 
approximating curve is revolved, each straight line segment generates 
a <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> <EM>gentgc</EM> solid.  This <EM>stack</EM> of solids is 
then combined to form the final approximation to the IGES entity.  
Exactly how these solids are combined depends on the form 
number of the IGES solid.  The form number is another piece of 
data that is included in the directory section entry for each entity.  
For a solid of revolution, the form number indicates whether the curve 
to be revolved is closed upon itself or is closed upon the axis of 
revolution.  If the curve is closed upon the axis of revolution, then 
the final object is merely the union of all the approximating 
solids.  If the curve is closed upon itself, then the final object 
must have a hollow section through the center, and the approximation 
must be built with the appropriate combination of unions and subtractions 
of the <EM>stack</EM> of solids.<P>

The solid assembly entity is directly analogous to the <EM>BRL-CAD</EM>
group and is converted directly to that form.  The boolean tree 
entity, however, presented some difficulties.  IGES defines the boolean 
tree in a postorder notation that allows for easy construction of 
a binary tree in memory through the use of a stack algorithm.  An 
example of a boolean tree is shown in figure 3.<P>

Figure 3. Boolean Tree Example
</PRE><P>
The postorder notation 
that an IGES translator would produce for this tree is
<PRE>
	<EM>A B C u + D E + u</EM>.
</PRE>
The equivalent infix notation for this tree is
<PRE>
	<EM>(A + (B u C)) u (D + E)</EM>.
</PRE>
where &quot;+&quot; represents the intersection operator and &quot;u&quot
represents the union operator.
Note that the parentheses are required for correct evaluation of this 
tree.<P>

Since <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> does not support postorder notation nor permit parenthetical 
expressions in region definitions, an IGES boolean tree cannot be 
directly converted to a <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> region, in general.  Because of its 
ancestry, <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> has inherited the property that there are implied 
parentheses at the union operators, i.e., all the operations between 
the union operators are performed first, then the unions are evaluated.  
These facts lead to some restrictions on the form of the boolean trees 
that may be directly converted to <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> regions.  These restrictions 
may be summed up by saying that no union operator may appear 
at a node in the tree below any nonunion operator.  In general, any 
boolean tree may be rewritten to satisfy that requirement  by applying 
a series of transformations to its subtrees.  An example of just such 
a transformation is shown in figure 4.<P>
<PRE>

Figure 4. Subtree Transformation
</PRE><P>
Here, a subtree of the previous 
example illustrates a situation where a union operator appears below 
an intersection operator.  This subtree is easily rewritten (as shown 
in the figure) to move the union operation up the tree.  When this 
subtree is placed back in the original tree, the result is a tree 
that conforms to the <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> syntaxwhile still producing the 
same resultant object.<P>

Figure 5. Final Tree Structure
</PRE><P>
Figure 5 illustrates the final tree structure, which can now be expressed 
in <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> syntax as
<PRE>
	<EM>A + B u A + C u D + E</EM>
</PRE>
This region is then constructed in the <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> model.<P>

A series of transformations was developed to convert from IGES 
postorder notation to <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> syntax by examining all possible subtree 
situations where a union operator appears below a nonunion operator 
and constructing an equivalent tree with the union operator at the 
top.  The only remaining difficulty is the fact that IGES allows boolean 
trees to reference other boolean trees.  In <EM>BRL-CAD</EM>, a group may reference 
another group, but a region referencing another region is generally 
not supported.  Since <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> groups are only unions of a collection 
of objects, it appears that after having solved the boolean tree problem, 
neither the <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> region nor the <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> group 
will satisfy our requirements.  However, the regions and groups in 
<EM>BRL-CAD</EM> are really just varieties of the same type of object called 
a combination in <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> with a flag in 
the structure indicating that a particular object is a region.  <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> 
actually supports combinations that reference other combinations as 
long as the combination isn't flagged as a region.  So the resulting 
boolean trees from IGES may be converted to <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> combinations.<P>
