== NAME

g-shell-rect - Produce triangulated shell from BRL-CAD model

== SYNOPSIS

*g-shell-rect*[-a _rpp_args_][-R _edge_tol_][-p _plotfile_][-X _lvl_][-d _debug_level_][-b][-n][-i _initial_ray_dir_][-g _cell_size_]-o _brlcad_output_file__database.g__object(s)_

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*g-shell-rect* converts the specified __objects(s)__ from a BRL-CAD model __database.g__ to a single NMG solid using raytracing. Rays are fired in a uniform grid. The direction for the first set of rays is chosen by calculating the presented area of the bounding box of the __object(s)__ and selecting the direction with the largest area. The user may override this by specifying a desired initial ray direction using the [opt]*-i* option (see below). The initial shell is constructed using only the first and last intersections with the __object(s)__. This will typically result in some rather large faces with normals at right angles to the ray direction. Unless the [opt]*-n* option is specified, these faces are then subdivided (according to the __cell_size__) and additional rays fired from the other two directions are used to refine their shape. The resulting NMG solid will be named __shell__ and will be written to the specified __brlcad_output_file__.

The following command line options are recognized:

*-g*__cell_size__::
Specify the dimensions (in millimeters) of the grid spacing.  The default is 50mm.

*-i*__initial_ray_dir__::
Specify the initial ray direction.  Valid values are X, Y, or Z. The best results are usually obtained by raytracing in the direction that produces the most hits first.

*-d*__debug_level__::
Set the debugging level.  Higher values produce more debugging information.

*-n*::
Suppresses the refinement stage (firing rays from the secondary and tertiary axis directions).

*-b*::
Output a BOT rather than an NMG.

*-a*__rpp_args__::
Add an RPP for refining.

*-R*__edge_tol__::
Supply edge tolerance.

*-p*__plotfile__::
Supply plotfile for plot edge breaking.

*-X*__lvl__::
Supply NMG debug flags.

*-o*__output.g__::
Specifies the name of the BRL-CAD geometry file to create.
