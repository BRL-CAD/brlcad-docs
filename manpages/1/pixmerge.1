.SH "NAME"
pixmerge \- merge two pix(5) or bw(5) images by a formula
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBpixmerge\fP [\-glen] [\-w \fIbytes_wide\fP] [\-C \fIr/g/b\fP] \fIforeground.pix\fP [\fIbackground.pix\fP] > \fIout.pix\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBpixmerge\fP, given two streams of data, typically
\fBpix\fP(5) or \fBbw\fP(5) images,
generates an output stream of the same size, where the value of the
output is determined by a formula involving the first (foreground)
stream and the second (background) stream, with the option of using a
constant in place of the background stream. This routine operates on a
pixel\-by\-pixel basis, and thus is independent of the resolution of the
image. More sophisticated processing can be performed by
\fBpixmatte\fP .
.sp
If a constant is to be used in place of the background stream, it is
supplied via the \fB\-C r/g/b\fP option, with the constant color
specified by r/g/b . (Exception: see below for default zeroes being
used with default \fB\-g\fP .) It is expected that there will be up to
\fIbytes_wide\fP slash\-separated constants given as a single
parameter here. If \fB\-C\fP is used, the \fIbackground.pix\fP
argument is omitted.
.sp
The formula can be any combination of \fB\-g\fP (fg greater than bg),
\fB\-l\fP (fg less than bg), \fB\-e\fP (fg equal to bg), \fB\-n\fP (fg
not equal to bg). For example, \fB\-le\fP selects the foreground pixel
when it is lexically less than or equal to the background pixel, that
is, when each byte of the foreground pixel is less than or equal to
the corresponding byte of the background pixel; if said relationship
is found to be false, the background pixel is selected.
.sp
The \fB\-w#\fP flag specifies the width (in bytes) of each "pixel";
the default is 3, \fIi.e.\fP \fBpix\fP(5) file format.  A
width of 1 is used for processing \fBbw\fP(5) files.
It is unclear if other widths are useful.
.sp
If no formula is specified, the default is to use \fB\-g\fP, taking
all foreground pixels greater than a constant (\fB\-C\fP parameter if
that option is used, otherwise defaulting to black, which is specified
with all bytes zero).  If the default formula and constant are used
(and \fB\-a\fP was NOT used), this is the same as:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
pixmerge \-g \-C 0/0/0 fg.pix
.fi
.if n .RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
gencolor 200 0 200 | pixmerge \-g fg.pix \- > out.pix
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
pixbackgnd \-t0 160 200 | pixmerge \-n fg.pix \- | pix\-fb
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
The second example is used to composite an \fBrt\fP(1)
generated image on top of a shaded background.
