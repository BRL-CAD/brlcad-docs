= Conic curve support
:pp: {plus}{plus}

LibreCAD supports basic entity types including ellipse. It's desirable
to have support for parabola and hyperbola as primitive entity types,
giving the LibreCAD equation solvers are capable of handling quartic
equations.

This imiplementation should be in LibreCAD V3, but backporting to the
current stable release V2 is also encouraged.
