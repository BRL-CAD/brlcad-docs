== NAME

rpp-cap - Creates an ARB6 with the specified height at a particular
	face of the given RPP.
   

== SYNOPSIS

*rpp-cap* {_rppname newname face height_} [0] [1]

== DESCRIPTION

Creates an ARB6 with the specified height at a particular face of the given RPP. The optional 0 and 1 refer to the orientation of the ARB6. If 0 is chosen, the peaks of the ARB6 are positioned at the midpoint between the first and second points and at the midpoint between the third and fourth points of the specified face. If 1 is chosen, the peaks of the ARB6 are positioned at the midpoint between the first and fourth points and at the midpoint between the second and third points of the specified face. The default is 0. 

== EXAMPLES

The two examples show the use of the [cmd]*rpp-cap* command to create an ARB6 	with the specified height at a particular face of a given RPP.  The second example shows 	the use of the "1" option. 

.Create an ARB6 shape with a specified height from a given RPP face.
====
[prompt]#mged>#[ui]`rpp-cap rpp.s cap.s 1234 20`

Creates an ARB6 shape named _cap.s_ that extends 20 units from the 	1234 face of the RPP. The peaks of the ARB6 will be at the midpoint between points 1 and 2 	and at the midpoint between points 3 and 4. 
====

.Create an ARB6 shape with a specified height from a given RPP face and having peaks 	between points 1 and 4 and between 2 and 3. 
====
[prompt]#mged>#[ui]`rcc-cap rcc.s cap.s 1234 20 1`

Creates an ARB6 shape named _cap.s_ that extends 20 units from the 	1234 face of the RPP. The peaks of the ARB6 will be at the midpoint between point 1 and 4 	and at the midpoint between points 2 and 3.
