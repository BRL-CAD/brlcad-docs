== NAME

bb - Report dimensional information about objects using Bounding Boxes

== SYNOPSIS

*bb* [_options_]... _objects_...

== DESCRIPTION

_bb_ calculates a bounding box for an object or set of objects supplied as arguments, and reports information about bounding box dimensions at the MGED command prompt.  It supports various options, most of which control the type of information reported.  It can optionally create an ARB8 in a database corresponding to the bounding box of the object(s).  By default, an axis-aligned bounding box (AABB) is created, but support for an oriented bounding box (OBB) is available as well. 

The _objects_ list consists of one or more geometry objects in the current database. 

*-c* bbox_object_name.s::
Create an ARB8 primitive in the current database with the dimensions of the bounding box of the object(s) listed.

*-d*::
Report dimensional information (length, width and height.)  On by default.

*-e*::
Report the extent of the bounding box using the min and max 3D points of the bounding box. 

*-o*::
Calculate an oriented bounding box instead of an axis aligned bounding box.  This will produce tighter bounding volumes if the geometry is not symmetric to the XYZ grid. Uses the algorithms and code from Barequet and Har-Peled - see the papers http://valis.cs.uiuc.edu/~sariel/papers/98/bbox.html[
Efficiently Approximating the Minimum-Volume Bounding Box
of a Point Set in Three Dimensions ](SODA 99) and http://valis.cs.uiuc.edu/~sariel/research/papers/00/diam.html[A
Practical Approach for Computing the Diameter of a
Point-Set] for details. 

*-q*::
Quiet mode - disable printing of the header, which is on by default.  Useful when processing output from bb. 

*-u*::
Ignore air volumes when calculating the bounding box. 

*-v*::
Print the volume of the bounding box.  On by default.
