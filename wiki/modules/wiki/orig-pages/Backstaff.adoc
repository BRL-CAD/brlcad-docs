Welcome to the BRL-CAD Backstaff! Some will consider this to be a
development http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technology_roadmap[roadmap]
for BRL-CAD, but it's more of a development
https://www.ion.org/museum/item_view.cfm?cid=2&scid=14&iid=31[backstaff]
because:

. it's only useful half of the time,
. there are a lot of assumptions,
. the http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planning_horizon[planning
horizon] isn't very
detailed

With most open source software development, you can only reflect on what
you've done or intend to do. Everything is tentative. Things get
implemented when a contributor has time and motivation.

Our focus is on being flexible, adaptive, and responsive. This
development "plan" is more of a common staging area so that we may hold
a common vision for *what* we're working towards even if we can't pin
down *_when_* we'll get there.
