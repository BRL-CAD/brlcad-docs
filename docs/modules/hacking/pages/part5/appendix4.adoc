= Code Example: Walking Geometry

BRL-CAD's models are hierarchical.  Primitive shapes are combined with
boolean operations into more complex shapes, which are in turn built
into even more complex shapes with additional operations.  Navigating
these hierarchies via tree walking is a standard operation in BRL-CAD.
