= Mug Creation Process

== 1. Outside of the cup

Use "eto" for the cup so that it will have more rounder edges and
middle. Name it _cup.s_. Then after that, adjust the shape's width and
set the "D" if you want to make the edges and middle more rounder.
Click "Apply" then to put some color on it, make it into a region
first and named it _cup.r_ then go to the Combination Editor and input
"53 20 0" (dark brown color) on the Color GUI.

== 2. Handle

Create _handle.s_ and use "pipe" for the handle so you can bend it to
a more unique shape than the torus by clicking the "Append Point" then
select the parts of the handle you wanted to add new points with.
Adjust the new points to the desired shape and position by clicking
"Move Point" and click the place where you want the points to be
moved.  The problem on this is that the adjusted points leave creases
on the shape which gives it a rougher appearance and needs a lot of
adjustments to lessen the creases. Do the same way on how put color on
_cup.r_ only name the new region _handle.r_.

== 3. Inside of the cup

To give it a white inside part, copy the shape of the outside cup (cp
cup.s inside.s) and name it inside.s. Adjust its "r", and "Rotate C"
until it is smaller and thinner than the outside cup. The space inside
of the cup might now looked too small for a cup and also that _cup.r_
would hide parts of _inside.s_ so make a region of _cup.r_ and
_inside.s_ as follows:

....
r inside.r u inside.s - cup.r
....

== 4. Rim

Place a torus for a rim so that the white color would overlap the
brown cup rim and give it a nicer appearance. Adjust "Radius 1" to fit
it to the cup's circumference, and "Radius 2" to fit it to the cup's
width.  After that make it into a region named _rim.r_.

== 5. Base

Use "sph" for the base then set its "C" to make it flatter. Make it into
a region named _base.r_ then type "53 20 0" on the Color GUI in
Combination Editor.

== 6. Coffee (optional)

If you want to put coffee in your mug, use "rcc" then adjust its "H"
"A,B" and "C,D" to fit in the cup. Name it _coffee.s_. Make it into
a region and name it _coffee.r_ then input "143 93 1" (light brown
color) on the Combination Editor and set the Shader to "glass". Set the
Mirror Reflectance to 0.05 to give it a liquid appearance and, to give
it a more coffee-like appearance, set the Transparency to 0.1. The
problem on setting the transparency to 0.1 rather than 0 is that the
Command Window would "complain" on overlapping.

== 7. Combining all regions

Combine all the regions and name it _coffeemug.c_ using this command:

....
comb coffemug.c u cup.r u inside.r u handle.r u rim.r u base.r u coffee.r
....

or without _coffee.r_:

....
comb coffemug.c u cup.r u inside.r u handle.r u rim.r u base.r
....

== 8. Raytracing the design

Now, Blast your design first before raytracing:

....
B coffeemug.c
....

Then raytrace your design using the Raytrace GUI in the File Menu and,
for best results, set the Background Color to white, the view in
"az35,el25", and also the Framebuffer option to "Overlay".
