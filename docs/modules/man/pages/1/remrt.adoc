== NAME

remrt - network distributed (remote) ray-trace dispatcher

== SYNOPSIS

*remrt* [_options_]... _model.g_ _objects_...

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*remrt* is intended to be an entirely plug-compatible replacement
for the xref:man:1/rt.adoc[*rt*(1)] program.  While _rt_ can operate
on more than one processor of a shared memory MIMD style
multi-processor, it can not spread the work out across the
network. [cmd]*remrt* and its companion program
xref:man:1/rtsrv.adoc[*rtsrv*(1)] implement a
xref:man:3/libpkg.adoc[*libpkg*(3)]-based protocol for distributing
the task of ray-traced rendering out to an arbitrary number of
processors on the network. Those processors can be from an arbitrary
mix of vendors, with differing instruction sets and data
representations, operating at widely different speeds.

[cmd]*remrt* provides two levels of fault-tolerance in its distributed
computation. First, any _rtsrv_ processor which fails (or whose
network link fails) will have its work reassigned automatically by
[cmd]*remrt* to other processors, so that the failure of that
processor does not hold up the progress of the computation.  On a
regular interval [cmd]*remrt* attempts to restart computation on
failed processors marked "active", so that when failed systems become
available again they are put back to work. Second, [cmd]*remrt* offers
a form of "checkpoint-restart" by carefully writing all received pixel
data immediately to disk.  If the machine running [cmd]*remrt* should
fail, when [cmd]*remrt* is restarted, it will determine what work
remains to be done and restart all the _rtsrv_ processes on the remote
machines.

[cmd]*remrt* takes exactly the same set of command line arguments as
xref:man:1/rt.adoc[*rt*(1)]. For a full discussion of those options,
consult the xref:man:1/rt.adoc[*rt*(1)] manual page. From within
xref:man:1/mged.adoc[*mged*(1)] the [cmd]*remrt* program can be run
from the current _mged_ view by giving the _mged_ command

....
rrt remrt -M -s###
....

where "+###+" is the image resolution desired. 

[cmd]*remrt* depends on the Berkeley _rsh (1)_ remote shell command
and the user's corresponding ".rhosts" file to automatically initiate
remote computation.

[cmd]*remrt* requires a control file called ".remrtrc" which specifies
a few essential parameters of the server machines (network hosts) that
are to participate in the distributed computation.  The ".remrtrc"
file contains a list of normal [cmd]*remrt* commands which are to be
executed before distributed processing is to begin. This can be useful
for establishing a variety of user-specific defaults. However, the
most important command to provide is a "host" command to describe each
of the remote hosts that will (or may) participate in the distributed
computation. Here is a sample ".remrt" file:

....
    host wolf	passive cd /tmp/cad/.remrt.4d
    host voyage	always cd /tmp/cad/.remrt.4d
    host whiz	hacknight convert /tmp
....

The first argument to the "host" command is the name of the server
machine. It will be converted to a fully qualified name by calling
xref:man:3/gethostbyname.adoc[*gethostbyname*(3)] and
xref:man:3/gethostbyaddr.adoc[*gethostbyaddr*(3)].

The second argument to the "host" command describes "when" this
machine should be used.

_always_:: says that whenever this host is not participating in the
computation, repeated attempts should be made (every 5 minutes) to
start an _rtsrv_ process on that machine. This option is most useful
for machines where the system administrator and/or owner of the
machine won't mind your using the machine at any time.  (Note that
_rtsrv_ runs at the lowest priority by default, so this isn't too
terribly uncivilized.  But be polite and ask first.)

_night_:: indicates that the machine should only be used during the
night and on weekends.  Night extends from 1800 through 0000 to
0800\. Saturday and Sunday are considered to be in night time for the
entire day.

_hacknight_:: indicates that the machine is owned by a late-night
"hacker", and can be used while that hacker is likely to be
asleep. Hacking tends to run from 1300 through 0000 to 0400, so
_hacknight_ is the time period from 0400 to 1300.

_passive_:: indicates that [cmd]*remrt* should never attempt to
initiate an _rtsrv_ process on this machine, but if the user should
happen to start _rtsrv_ manually on the machine and direct it to join
the computational fray, then the necessary information will be
available.

If an unlisted machine should join the fray, it will be added with a
"when" value of _passive_ and a "where" value of _convert_. When an
_rtsrv_ passes from night into day, it is automatically terminated by
[cmd]*remrt* at the appointed time.

The third argument to the "host" command is the "where" parameter,
which indicates where the BRL-CAD ".g" file (and any related texture
maps) can be found.

_cd_:: indicates that the _rtsrv_ program should change directory
xref:man:2/cd.adoc[*cd*(2)] to the indicated directory path, and
should just read the data files in that directory as _rt_ normally
would. This can be used to specify NFS or RFS mounted remote
directories, or static copies of the binary database file(s) needed to
perform the ray-tracing. This is the most efficient way of operating
__rtsrv__, but it also requires some manual preparation on the part of
the user to install all the required files in the designated location.

_convert_:: indicates that [cmd]*remrt* should send across an ASCII
machine-independent version of the ".g" database file using the
command:
+
....
asc2g < file.g | rsh host 'cd directory; g2asc > file.g'
....
+
before starting up the _rtsrv_ program in that same directory. This
relieves the user of the burden of setting up the ".g" database file,
but suffers from several drawbacks. First, the transmission of a large
database can take a noticeable amount of time. Second, should the
server host go down and then re-join the fray, the database will be
sent again, because [cmd]*remrt* has no easy way to tell if the
previous ".g" file is still intact after the crash/restart. Third,
[cmd]*remrt* has no way to tell what auxiliary files might be needed
for this ".g" file, and thus can not send them automatically. If the
".g" file references height field, extruded bit-map, or volumetric
solids, the associated data files will not be present on a _convert_
mode server.  The same applies for texture map and bump map files.

[cmd]*remrt* uses several different strategies for optimizing the
dispatching of work. These can be controlled by the "allocate"
command. If "allocate frame" has been specified, then the work
allocation method is a "free for all", allocating work from one frame
at a time to all servers as they become ready for more. This maximizes
the CPU overhead for prepping (because all CPUs will prep all frames),
but it also provides the shortest wall-clock time to getting the first
frame finished. This mode is recommended for demonstrations, and other
situations where people are sitting around waiting for results to
appear on the screen.

If the "allocate load" command has been given, then new servers will
not be assigned to a given frame unless there is at least enough work
remaining on that frame to require 10 percent of that server's
measured performance capacity. Otherwise the server is started on a
subsequent frame.

If the "allocate movie" command is given, then each server is
allocated a whole frame to do.  This minimizes the CPU time spent in
the overhead of prepping the frame, and tends to maximize overall
throughput, at the price of making you wait a long time for the first
frame to finish.  This mode is best used when crunching out large
numbers of frames for an animation. (See also the
xref:man:1/scriptsort.adoc[*scriptsort*(1)] command for a clever
power-of-two script rearrangement technique first proposed by Jim
Blinn).

The output can be stored either in a file, or sent to the current
framebuffer, the same as with xref:man:1/rt.adoc[*rt*(1)].

When [cmd]*remrt* is run without command line arguments, it enters an
interactive mode.  In this mode, the current framebuffer can be
assigned and released, frames can be added to the list of pending
work, and many other control and status commands can be used.

Normally [cmd]*remrt* runs in a batch mode, taking all its information
from the command line, the script file on stdin, and the ".remrtrc"
file. If you wish to issue an interactive-style command to
[cmd]*remrt* while it is running in batch mode, this can be
accomplished by giving an extra argument to _rtsrv_, which will simply
pass on the command and exit.

For example:

....
rtsrv server_host 4446 status
....

would send the command "status" to the [cmd]*remrt* process running on
the machine called "server_host" and listening at port 4446. 4446 is
the port used by the first copy of [cmd]*remrt* running on a machine.
If a second copy of [cmd]*remrt* is started while the first one
continues to run, it will be assigned port 4447.  One is added to the
port number repeatedly until an available port is found. Normally you
do not need to worry about which port is being used, unless you wish
to send commands there directly. The
xref:man:1/netstat.adoc[*netstat*(1)] command can sometimes be useful
to track down which ports are being used.

.Performing a Basic remrt/rtsrv Raytrace
====
The following steps will set up a local (single machine) example remrt
session. This does not utilize the full power of the remrt system, but
will illustrate how the individual pieces relate to each other.
Rather than use rsh, each process will be launched manually.

Launch an [cmd]*fbserv* instance on the desired port and with the
desired type (we will use port 0 and /dev/X for a Linux-based X11
rendering - windows users can try /dev/wgl.) For a somewhat larger
render we specify a size of 2048 pixels square.

[ui]`fbserv -s2048 -p0 -F/dev/X`

If an graphical framebuffer was specified, a window should appear.
Otherwise, fbserv will silently wait for input.

In MGED, set up the scene you wish to render and then save a script
with [cmd]*saveview*

[ui]`saveview remrt.rt`

Edit the script and replace the [cmd]*rt* command with [cmd]*remrt*.
Replace the output file specification ([opt]*-o filename*) with a -F0
option to point the render to the fbserv started in the previous
step. Also add a -s2048 option to specify a rendering size to match
that provided to the fbserv.

Run the script to launch remrt.  You should see output indicating the
program has launched.  (Note: the port number printed by the default
output is not useful - you want to use 4446 by default to connect to
remrt.)

....

Note that it is seeking servers - we have not given [cmd]*remrt* any
instructions on how to start its own.  To start a server and see the
system work, we set up a local directory containing the same .g file
we used to set up the scene, and from that directory run
[cmd]*rtsrv*. (For these purposes we also add the [opt]*-d* so we can
see more of what is happening. Without this option, if anything isn't
set up correctly rtsrv can fail with cryptic errors.)

[ui]`rtsrv -d machinename 4446`

If successful, both [cmd]*remrt* and [cmd]*rtsrv* will being producing
output. The [cmd]*rtsrv* will be more verbose, and should look like
the following:

== BUGS

Most deficiencies observed while using the [cmd]*remrt* program are
usually with the xref:man:1/rt.adoc[*rt*(1)] program, with which it
shares a substantial amount of common code, or with the
xref:man:3/librt.adoc[*librt*(3)] library. If a frame fails to render
properly, try processing it on a single machine using
xref:man:1/rt.adoc[*rt*(1)] to determine if the problem is in the
ray-tracing side of things, or the distributed computation side of
things.
