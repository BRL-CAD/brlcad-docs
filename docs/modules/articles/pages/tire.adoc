Vehicle wheels are often approximated in BRL-CAD models with tori,
cylinders, or other basic geometric shapes that represent a very rough
visual and geometric approximation of a tire/wheel combination. The
tire procedure provides BRL-CAD users with the ability to rapidly
generate complex tire and wheel structures with standard dimensional
input information.

== Overview

Traditionally, http://brlcad.org[BRL-CAD] tire models have been
created using a single cylinder, a torus intersected with a cylinder,
or in some cases additional combinations of these primitives.  While
these approximations are often sufficient for analytical purposes the
resulting model is typically a poor visual match to the real tire when
raytracing.  Creating more complex models to better approximate the
tire's shape almost always requires more resources than can be
justified.

The `tire` tool offers a method to generate a model that is
dimensionally close to a "real" tire using primitives and CSG
operations.  The primitives used are the elliptical torus (eto), right
circular cylinder (rcc), ellipsoid (ell), and truncated general cone
(tgc).  When tread is added, the sketch and extrude primitives are
also used.

By default, a basic steel wheel (a.k.a.  "rim") is included in the
model.  If this wheel does not work for a given modeling purpose, it
is quite simple to remove it and substitute in a user-defined wheel so
long as the dimensions of the user supplied wheel match the standard
wheel at the key points (radius and width).

While the `tire` tool _can_ supply tread, it does not do so by
default.  Complex tread patterns can SIGNIFICANTLY increase the time
for analysis and visualization, so the modeler needs to bear this cost
in mind.

The tire generated is always centered at the global origin.

== Specifying a Tire with Standard Dimensional Conventions

The default behavior for the tire procedure with no arguments given is
to produce a tire of dimensions 215/55R17 without tread in a file
named tire.g.

Since this default is unlikely to meet the needs of most specific
modeling tasks, almost all uses of `tire` will need the `-d` flag to
customize the dimensions:

[cmd]`tire -d 255/40R18`

There are actually a wide variety of standards used in practice to
specify tire dimensions.  Generally the majority of them have the same
"core" information plus additional performance and rim compatibility
notations.  At this time, BRL-CAD supports the following input format:

[%header, cols="5*~", frame="all"]
|===
|Width(mm)
|separator
|Ratio (#/100)
|separator
|Inner Diameter(in)
|===

Separators can be any non-numeric character, but normally are either
"/", "-", or in the case of the latter separator a letter denoting
tire structure.  Only single character separators are allowed. {fn-1}
The ratio specifies the sidewall height in terms of the overall tire
width - for example, if a tire is 100mm wide and the Ratio is 40, the
sidewall height is 40mm.  Examples of valid input strings for tire
dimensions include:

[cols="h,~", frame="all"]
|===
|255/40R18
|Width=255mm, Ratio=40, Wheel Diameter=18in

|250-50R17
|Width=250mm, Ratio=50, Wheel Diameter=17in

|180/100/15
|Width=180mm, Ratio=100, Wheel Diameter=15in
|===

All three values must be present to have a valid input string.  Also
note that at the moment this procedure takes ONLY integer arguments
and single non-numeric character separators, so the above formatting
restrictions need to be observed.  Examples of INVALID inputs include:

[cols="h,~", frame="all"]
|===
|255.0/40R18
|First number is floating point rather than integer.

|250-50RD17
|Multiple characters in second separator.

|185.65/15
|"." has significance numerically and will not read correctly.
|===

If more precision is needed on any of these inputs, the `tire` tool
offers other command-line options to use instead of (or even in
combination with) the _d_ flag which accept floating point input.
When used _with_ the _d_ flag, they override the value for their
particular parameter supplied to the _d_ flag.  They are the _W_ flag
for maximum width, _R_ for the ratio, and _D_ for the diameter of the
wheel.  For example, if a width of 255.5mm was needed, the command
could be:

[cmd]`tire -d 255/40R18 -W 255.5`

There are limits to the dimensional configurations that can be modeled
by `tire` (for example, hub width can not be wider than the maximum
tire width), but it should cover most real-world dimensions.  Some
examples:

.Example models generated by use of [cmd]__tire__'s dimensional flag.

The model that is created by this routine results in a hollow tire
with a thickness (by default) related to its radius - the greater the
tire radius, the thicker the tire "walls".  The structure created is a
fairly good geometric tire shape, but does not contain any internal
structure _within_ the tire material itself.  Modern radial tires in
reality are composed of several different layers of varying materials
designed to enhance structural strength and performance, but (as of
April 2008) the `tire` tool approximates tire surfaces and walls as
being a single region.

[[_options_for_tire]]
== Options for Tire Tread Modeling

Tread is the most difficult part of a tire to define in terms of the
amount of input data required.  At present it is not possible for a
user to define tread on the command line - only built-in tread options
are available. {fn-2}} Tread profile and tread pattern are the two
factors to consider when specifying tread.  Tread profile is the
"shape" of the tread on the edges of the tread pattern.  Many truck
tires have a "squared off" tread, while automobile tires tend to have
more rounded tread.  Different patterns can be combined with different
profiles.

The _t_ flag controls the tread profile, and the _p_ flag controls the tread pattern.
Currently, the following profiles and patterns are available: 

[%header, cols="4*", frame="all"]
|===
|Profile #
|Profile (t)
|Pattern #
|Pattern (p)

|1
|Curved
|1
|All-Weather

|2
|Squared Off
|2
|Off-Road
|===

Using either the _t_ or _p_ flags to the tire command will trigger
tread generation.  For each flag, a default on the other flag is
assumed - if ONLY the _p_ flag is specified, the t value is assumed to
be the same and vice versa.  To override the assumption, both flags
may be specified.  Here is the default output for style one:

.Combination of curved profile and all-weather tread pattern - generated with the command [cmd]_tire -p 1_
image::tire_fig04.png[]

Style two is intended more for trucks and other rugged vehicles:

.Combination of squared-off profile and off-road tread - generated with the command [cmd]_tire -p 2_
image::tire_fig05.png[]

Using _t_ in place of _p_ would also have produced the same model.
Internally the `tire` command must use some pattern and profile for
every tread it creates, and for ease of use it will select a default
if a pattern or profile is specified by itself.  Using the flags
together can produce different results - for example, profile 2 with
pattern 1:

.ination of squared-off profile and all-weather tread pattern - generated by [cmd]_tire -t 2 -p 1_
image::tire_fig06.png[]

There exist two additional user level flags that can change the
behavior of the tread routine.  The first is the _g_ flag, which can
be used to specify different tread depths in integer numbers of 32nds
of an inch.  For example, the default number two style previously can
be rendered with a deeper tread:

[cmd]`tire -p 2 -g 25 to produce a different look:`

.Combination of squared-off profile and off-road tread with increased tread depth - generated by [cmd]_tire -p2 -g 25_
image::tire_fig07.png[]

The other flag is the _c_ flag, which allows user control over how
many copies of the master tread pattern are used to encircle the tread
surface of the tire.  This can be used to create courser or finer
tread with the same geometric pattern.  For example, if the first
profile, second pattern and count of 100 are used:

.Combination of curved profile, off-road tread and increased tread pattern count - generated by [cmd]`tire -p 2 -t 1 -c 100`
image::tire_fig08.png[]

Adjusting the count of patterns can be a way to get a different visual
tread style without defining a new tread pattern, although it is
unlikely to result in a "real" pattern in the sense of representing an
in-use tire tread.

[NOTE]
====
It is important when using the count flag to remember that tread
patterns are actual geometry and a high count of patterns can slow
down a raytrace considerably.  A strategy for models that will see a
variety of uses is to include both treaded and slick (non-treaded)
tire models in the database under different names, make a tire-model.c
combination that is referenced by the vehicle model, and include
either the treaded or non-treaded model in the tire-model.c
combination based on the analysis.

== Setting Tire Thickness

Tire thickness is manipulated via the _u_ flag.  By default, the tire
procedure will adjust the thickness of the tire according to the size
of the tire, but there may be cases where it is desirable to change
this thickness.

Let's say, for the sake of argument, a model of a large vehicle tire
is needed and it is known that a very thick wall is being used.  To
start, input the dimensional information:

[cmd]`tire -d 395/85R20 -p 2 -g 30`

.External view of a 395/85R20 tire with off-road tread and deepened tread grip.

Now, examine the cross section in normal and surface normal views (the
tread pattern and depth are added so the cross section WITH tread is
shown - it will change with and without tread):

.Cross section views - default and surface normal - of the default thickness on the previous 395/85R20 tire.
image::tire_fig10.png[]

This is a visual check - other tools are available for actual
dimensional testing.  Let's say the desired thickness is 70mm.  The
tire is re-generated thus:

[cmd]`tire -d 395/85R20 -p 2 -g 30 -u 70`

Examining the cross sections again, the thickness increase is clearly
seen:

.Cross section views - default and surface normal - of the new 395/85R20 tire with increased thickness.
image::tire_fig11.png[]


== Changing the Rim Width

The default behavior of `tire` is to make the rim width (the width of
the tire at the point where the outer wall connects with the steel
wheel) equal to the width of the tread, which is in turn defined
internally as a fraction of the total width.  This normally produces
reasonable tires, but `tire` does provide the _j_ flag to allow custom
values for rim width.  The input units are inches.

[[_changing_the_redial]]
== Changing the Radial Location of the Maximum Tire Width

When `tire` accepts a maximum width specification, it internally
decides on a default distance from the tire center where that maximum
will occur.  This parameter can be adjusted by the modeler with the
_s_ flag.  Some examples using the narrow rim width model settings
from the previous section:

.From left to right, the _s_ flag settings are 260, 270 and 280.  Notice in the surface normal view the change in color gradient on the side walls, and in the normal view notice the different shapes the tires exhibit.  The visual impact of this parameter can be fairly
image::tire_fig13.png[]


== Other Options

The other flags available in `tire` relate to naming of the top-level
tire object.  The _a_ flag automatically appends the dimensional
information to the name, making it simple to import multiple tires of
different dimensions into a single .g file with the MGED `dbconcat`
command.  The _n_ option allows the modeler to specify a string other
than "tire" for the root name of the top level object.  These options
can work individually or in concert.  So, for example, to generate a
top-level name of "car-255-55R17" instead of "tire" for the top level
object the following will work:

[cmd]`tire -a -n "car"`

By default, the procedure creates a file called "tire.g" to contain
the model.  If some other name is desired, a different file name can
be supplied as the final argument to the tire procedure.  For example,

[cmd]`tire mytire.g`

will create the "mytire.g" file and insert the default tire model. 

[[_structure_of_a_tire]]
== Structure of a Tire Model

Although it is not visible to the eye in normal raytracing, the tire
models do include knowledge in the model of the presence of air inside
the tire as well as the tire and wheel structures themselves.  For
illustration purposes, the following image displays the air region
inside the tire:

.Visualization of air region inside a tire.
image::tire_fig14.png[]

The three material regions are defined immediately below the top-level
object:

[subs="+quotes"]
....
[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#l tire#
[output]#tire:  --
   u tire-215-55R17.r
   u air-215-55R17.r
   u wheel-215-55R17.r#
....

The names of these regions will change with the dimensions of the tire
requested, but the basic form will remain consistent.  The
tire-215-55R17.r region holds the tire and tread (if tread was
requested), wheel-215-55R17.r holds the rim and internal hub of the
wheel, and air-215-55R17.r defines a volume inside the tire and wheel
not occupied by the other regions.

[subs="quotes"]
....
[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#tree -d 2 tire#
[output]#tire/
	u tire-215-55R17.r/R
		u tire-solid-215-55R17.c/
		- tire-cut-215-55R17.c/
	u air-215-55R17.r/R
		u wheel-air-215-55R17.c/
		u tire-cut-215-55R17.c/
	u wheel-215-55R17.r/R
		u Inner-Hub-215-55R17.c/
		u Wheel-Rim-215-55R17.c/#
....

Below this level, the structure describes the details of cuts and
combination interactions needed to specify the tire shape.

[NOTE]
====
Due to the nature of the primitives used to define these shapes,
operations such as scaling along one axis may produce unexpected
results.  Generally speaking, it is almost always easier and less
error-prone to re-generate a tire model with different parameters than
it is to edit the tire structure directly.  The wheel region is fairly
simple to remove and work with but the tire/tread geometries are
_much_ more involved.

== Summary

* `tire` is a procedural geometry database tool to create
  sophisticated tire models using standard dimensional specifications.
* The model consists of three regions which define air, tire, and
  wheel structures.
* The wheel is generated in response to the tire dimensions and there
  is currently only one wheel type available in this procedure (users
  may model and substitute their own wheel designs).
* Tread is not modeled by default due to performance considerations
  but can be added using options.
* Fine grained control of parameters such as tire thickness is
  available with optional user flags.
