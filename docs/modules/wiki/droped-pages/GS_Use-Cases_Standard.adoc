'''

= Notes on Use Cases

* A use case is a sequence of interactions that describes one clear
goal for the user.
* One or many Use Cases may make up the functionality described in a
single link:GS_Requirements_Standard[Requirement].

= Sample Use Cases

* Identified Actors for the GS Network Library:
 ** Network
 ** GS Application that uses GSNetLib

==1. List all Use Cases for an Actor== The Actor 'Network' has the
following use-cases:

* Transport message to GSNetLib
* Transport message from GSNetLib

The Actor 'GS Application' has the following use-cases:

* Open new connection
* Close connection
* Listen for new connections
* Place Message into SendQueue
* Retrieve Message from ReceiveQueue

==2.Detail Each Use-Case (Pseudo-Formally)==

* Usually written somewhat vaguely, so as to describe a process, but
not detail how to implement code.
* This can be difficult for describing complex Use Cases. In this
event, use of a form of pseudo code is acceptable.

=== Ex 1: OpenNewOutBoundConnection

*Use Case*: OpenNewOutBoundConnection

*Initiating Actor*: GS Application

*Participating Actors*: (none)

*Preconditions*: (none)

*Primary Flow*:

1 Initiating Actior (IA) requests a new _connection object_, providing
hostname and port.

2 The _connection object_ attempts to connect to _hostname_ on _port._

3 If connection is successful, GSNetLib returns a connected _connection
object_

*Alternative Flows*

*Extention Point*: During step #3.

*Precondition*: The connection is not successful.

3.1 GSNetLib returns a null object.

*Remerge Point*: None. Alternative end to use case.

=== Ex 2: OpenNewInBoundConnection

*Use Case*: OpenNewInBoundConnection

*Initiating Actor*: GSNetLib Listener

*Participating Actors*: (none)

*Preconditions*: (none)

*Primary Flow*:

1 Initiating Actior (IA) requests a new _connection object_.

2 If connection is successful, GSNetLib returns a connected _connection
object_

*Alternative Flows*

*Extention Point*: During step #2.

*Precondition*: The connection is not successful.

2.1 GSNetLib refuses the incoming connection.

*Remerge Point*: None. Alternative end to use case.
