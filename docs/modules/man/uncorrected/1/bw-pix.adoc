== NAME

bw-pix - convert a black and white image to color format

== SYNOPSIS

*bw-pix*[[-s _squaresize_][-w _width_][-n _height_]][-o _out.pix_][[<]_in.bw_]>[_out.pix_]

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*bw-pix* converts a black and white xref:man:5/bw.adoc[*bw*(5)] format file to a color xref:man:5/pix.adoc[*pix*(5)] format file. Each input value is replicated three times, thus the resulting output file has the same value in all three color planes. An input file name can be given, else input comes from stdin. Output will go to stdout unless an optional output file name is given.
