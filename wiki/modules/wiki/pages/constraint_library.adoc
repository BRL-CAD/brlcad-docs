= libpc: Parametrics and Constraints

Proposed sytem for parametrics and constraint implementation by Dawn
Thomas (homovulgaris)

Provision for Parametrics and constraints greatly improves the
performance of a Computer Aided Design System both in terms of geometry
generation as well as analysis. Considering the unix model of division
into multiple tools and libraries for individual functions as well as
the fact that parametric/constraint functionalities are *not critical*
elements in terms of geometry generation and raytracing, a logical
solution would be the implemenation of a separate library (libpg)

== Function

libpg adds the following provisions to BRL-CAD system

. Creation & Modification of parameter-based geometry objects
. Creation of constraints between geometry objects
. Creation & Storage of Parametric Objects (non-geometric)
. Modification of geometry objects in .g files to indicate parametric
nature

Part 1 would include building parametric objects based on existing
non-parametric geometry objects as well as generation of purely
parametric geometry. libpg acts as a library which sits above librt
using the librt methods for creation and modification of geometry

To efectively implement constraints, the library would first implement
constraint functionality which currently exists in terms of implicit
constraints ( Non negative radius, Perpendicular vectors etc. ) To see a
list of implicit constraints in the various BRL-CAD primitives See link:A_Survey_of_Implicit_Constraints_in_Primitives[A
Survey of Implicit Constraints in
Primitives]

== Constraints and CSPs

A constraint system can be looked upon as a system of variables, their
associated domains and set of constraints/relationships between the
variables.

Fundamentally this can be visualised using a constraint network which is
a 3-tuple. Further we can have a graph based visualization of the same
using vertices as variables and edges connecting vertices as
constraints. It would be intuitive only for networks having binary
(between two variables) or unary (with self) constraints. Otherwise, one
has to visualize hypergraphs which contain hyperedges which is basically
a line connecting multiple vertices for example. Also note that there
could arise a situation where constraints depend on constraints ( edges
connected to edges in the above discussion ) and hence such hypergraphs
don't fit neatly into the bipartite graph structure.

as well as links to resources on Constraints in general and geometrical
constraints in particular, please see link:Constraint_Satisfaction[Constraint
Satisfaction]

== Library architecture

LibPC is composed of two sections which are functionally implemented
using 4 modules as represented in the diagram below.

The modules respectively are ( in the order of operation during a
read-out solution process)

. *Reader/Import* which reads from the .g file and generates C-based
internal structs
. *Constraint Network Generator/ Constraint Variable System
Generator* which takes the above structs and produces the
respective Variable and Constraint (pcVariable.h and pcConstraint.h)
class objects and their graph/hypergraph representation
. *Solver* which takes the above Constraint Network as an input and
generates a solution / multiple solutions or in effect a Solution
object

//

. *Geometry Updater* which uses the above solution and takes care of
the rest such as

* suggest user to select a value in case of multiple solutions for
narrowing down the solution range
* update the various parameters of all *associated geometry*
* write the data onto the .g file

== Implementation Details

For effective integration with librt system as well as rest of existing
brl-cad architecture, the Reader as well as Geometry Updater is entirely
in C using standard datastructures. At the same time to make use of the
functionality offered by various graph algorithms of boost as well as
the power of object oriented programming model in constraint solution,
the Constraint Network generator as well as solver is entirely coded in
C{pp}. Extensive use of Boost library is expected, in particular

. constrained_value system : for representing implicit constraints
using a predicate system
. Boost Graph Library : for graph based representation of the
constraints. *Since BGL does not have support for Hypergraphs, the
author plans to implement hypergraphs independently while adhering
to Boost standards ( probable addition to boost itself)*
. Boos Spirit Library : for the parser based generation of constraint
objects from expressions.

Spirit is an object-oriented recursive-descent parser generator
framework implemented using template meta-programming techniques.
Expression templates allow us to approximate the syntax of Extended
Backus-Normal Form (EBNF) completely in C{pp}. Spirit details available at
http://www.boost.org/doc/libs/1_35_0/libs/spirit/index.html[boost.org]

== Constraint object architecture

An object oriented method of implementation would be the creation of a
mixed ( in the sense that they contain both geometric and non-geometric
information ) object. The object architecture is as shown below which
shows the data types as well as the public and private methods.

=== Parametric Geometric Objects

From an Object Oriented point of view the major advantages is in terms
of the structuring of data and in particular the system of calling
methods or procedures. In effect each object knows how to evaluate
equations within its space. For example a line or a curve *knows* (
has a method to ) calculate and return the coordinates of a point with a
certain parameter value in its space ( a point at 0.6 ratio of length of
the curve) With this value ( coordinates) thus returned and with the
existing knowledge ( parent: curveid , parameter value:0.6 ) a
parametric point object has the methods to instantiate it and store it.

=== Constraint Objects

The above method is efficient and useful only in the generation,
modification and analysis of new geometry based on existing parametric/
non-parametric geometry. The evaluation method for constraints between
already existing independent geometry would require special constraint
objects. The effective difference between these objects and the earlier
arises from the fact that generation of the parametric geometric objects
depend on parametrics whereas constraints may or may not be feasible and
thus evaluation would result in multiple solutions and they represent
relationship between two independently defined elements ( parametrically
or not )

== Integration with librt

Two major aspects of integration with librt are

. Database I/O
. Declaration/ Extraction of parameters/variables from respective
rt_*_internal structures

Since most of the database input-output presently is completely handled
by librt, it is expedient to use the same convention for writing the new
non-geometric constraint object to the database. This is achieved
through the pc_constraint_export and pc_constraint_import functions
which are called by such functions as wdb_export or
rt_db_put_internal via a new functab entry in table.c Or in more
detail the steps taken to achieve these are

. Definition of ID_CONSTRAINT (39) in raytrace.h ( corresponding
increment to ID_MAXIMUM)
. Creation of a corresponding entry to functab array in table.c
. Addition of pc_constraint_export,pc_constraint_import and
pc_constraint_ifree functions

Regarding the declaration or extraction of parameters, the method of
approach is to use a callback function rt_functab. Associated with each
existing element we add a rt_*_params function which is called via
the functab. This would declare the list of parameters it is built on as
well as the list of implicit constraints on these parameters if any (
for example in the case of an ellipse there are 4 parameters: 1 point -
center, 3 vectors-a,b,c and associated constraints ). This data is
stored as a pc_pc_set (ParameterConstraint Set) This way, after the
implementation of libpc we can remove most of the code from existing
rt_*_prep functions which do such implicit constraint checking
handling the same via libpc

. Addition of rt_*_params to the RT_DECLARE_INTERFACE macro in
table.c
. Addition to the functab table in table.c
. Definition of corresponding function is various primitives/*.c
files

*What should be the convention for naming the parameters ? Also there
is a certain issue in the sense that some of the geometry are special
cases of more generic geometry. So for a sphere we are concerned with
only radius and center where as it is defined using ( point center) and
3 vectors (a b c). Should we name the parameter radius make 3 fastf_t
* to a[0], b[1], and c[2] Or should we make 3 vectp_t to a,b,c
or make 1 fast_t* to a[0], doing a further check/constraint that
a[0]=b[1]=c[2] ?*

_[I think the naming convention should be as consistent as possible
with the names used in the MGED user interface. For example, when a
sphere is edited in MGED, the parameters available are V (the center),
and 3 radius vectors (A, B, and C). Similarly, an RCC or TRC has all the
parameters of a TGC. Note also that all objects in a BRL-CAD database
file are accessed by unique names. A convention for producing unique
names for the constraint objects is needed. Depending on how these
constraint objects are accessed by a user, the names of the constraint
objects might not ever need to exposed to the user. Objects in the
database can be "hidden" so that they do not normally appear in
listings] - JRA_

The datastructures necessary for the exchange of information
(pc_pc_set which itself is built using a constraint set structure and
parameter set structure) are defined currently in raytrace.h (Shift to
pc.h in future? )

== Evaluation System

June 10th: The idea is to implement a constraint network using graph
representation of boost c{pp} library. From the solvers point of view the
constraint network would be composed of the following ( which are class
definitions in pc_solver.h file)

* Constraint Network: A Graph composed of vertices being parameters
and edges being constraint relations. The difference from the normal
graph is in the sense that an edge (or hyperedge ) maybe connecting
more than two vertices.
 ** Parameter Object: Vertex of the graph:
  *** Pointers to various constraints it is connected to
 ** Constraint Object: Edge/Hyperedge of the graph - Relation
between parameters
  *** Pointers to the parameters int the particular relation
  *** Relation : Basic representation of the relationship
   **** Relation Stack : The stack based representation of the
relationship

The action of the Solver object/method is the production of a Solution
Class A Solution is basically an instantiation of parameters along with
their possible values or an instantiation of the form ( param1= value,
param2=value and so on) In this case the value is basically a region of
the domain the parameter could occupy.

For example consider parameter set p1,p2,p3 The solution maybe

. (p1, 0.5-1.5; p2, 0.2) : P3 can have any value if P2 =0.2 and P1
lies in the range [0.1,1.5]
. (p1, 1.8; p2, 0.3-0.8; p3, 0.3-0.9) : P1=1.8, and P2 lies in the
range [0.3,0.8] and P3 in the range [0.3,0.9]
. (p1, 2.3; p2, 2.2; p3, 1.4) : Unique solution P1=2.3, P2=2.2, P3=1.4

=== Treatment of domain of parameters

. Option A: If a particular parameter has a domain(0.5<x<2.5)
This can be viewed as the existance for two unary constraints on the
parameter x ( x>0.5 and x<2.5 )
. Option B: Utilization of a Domain class which basically is dynamic
array of individual domains ( by individual domain I imply a
[min,max] region )

=== Transfer of data from database to solver

Modus operandi:

. Import data and create pc_pc_set using rt_*_params functions
via rt_functab
. Run a domain extractor on the constraint objects in pc_set
. Generate the constraint network
. Call Solver

Initial draft/intent

`It would be ideal to provide both analytical and numeric evaluation methods the  second one being of`
`primary importance in terms of constraint based  calculations. Considering the standard methods of`
`parametrization ( see Enumeration below ) I  think the implementation of an analytic solving system `
`would be easier. Though  for the solution of more complex equation as well as majority of constraints,`
`libpg will have to provide support for numerical solutions.`
