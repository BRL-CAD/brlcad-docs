* The following is the begining of a reply message on the BRL-CAD help
forum

(http://sourceforge.net/mailarchive/message.php?msg_id=1010480):

A user on the BRL-CAD help forum recently asked twenty rather insightful
and detailed questions regarding MGED that I felt would be a good idea
to share with those on the mailing lists as well. Some of the questions
frequently come up in discussion, so hopefully these answers will be of
use to many others out there as well. Also, note that some of the
questions are covered in the BRL-CAD tutorial series available at
http://brlcad.org under the Documents section. Users are encouraged to
suggest other documents and documentation that would be of use. As
always, if folks aren't happy with an answer or state of affairs, please
feel free to post a feature request at
https://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=3D105292&atid=3D640805 (with
one request per submission and lots of detail). The questions from this
particular user along with my answers are provided in following below.

Cheers!

Sean
