== Introduction

The Geometry Conversion Library (GCV or libgcv) provides a unified API for geometry conversion capabilities under a plugin-based architecture. 

The GCV public API is declared in C headers located within ``include/gcv/``.
The single `include/gcv.h` header includes the entire GCV public API. 

== Architecture

The Geometry Conversion Library consists of a stream-based API for geometry conversion and associated operations.
Input and output are provided by "reader" and "writer" converters (provided by plugins). Intermediate operations are provided by "filters". Readers and writers are types of filters that provide input and output support for model formats, while basic filters apply transformations to models and geometry. 

Geometry is stored in an in-memory BRL-CAD database (``struct db_i`` in ``include/rt/db_instance.h``) during the intermediate steps of conversion.
For writer filters, this database is marked read-only and its geometry should not be modified.
All names within a BRL-CAD database must be unique.

== Building GCV

GCV can be built in a similar manner as other BRL-CAD libraries.
After configuring with CMake, building the `libgcv` target will produce a dynamic library.
For Unix-based systems, the procedure should be similar to the following: 
----

$ cd brlcad
$ mkdir build
$ cd build
$ cmake ..
$ make libgcv
----

Plugins can be built under `gcv_[replaceable]``plugin_name``` targets, or collectively under the `gcv_plugins` target. 

The command-line utility can be built under the `gcv` target.
At this time, the `gcv` program is not installed automatically; the binary will be placed into ``build/src/conv/gcv/``. 

== Example: Using GCV in an application

The following code illustrates a basic use of GCV from within an application.
Note that there may be multiple filters providing import/export capabilities for a given format; the below code simply selects the first matching filter encountered. 

.gcv_app.c

== GCV Public API

The public API for interacting with GCV filter plugins is summarized below. 

.GCV public filter API
[cols="1,1", frame="none"]
|===
|``struct gcv_context``
|Stores the conversion state. Plugins may store messages in the `bu_avs_t` member ``messages``.

|``gcv_context_init()``
|Initialize a ``struct gcv_context``. Creates an in-memory `struct db_i` for conversion data.

|``gcv_context_destroy()``
|Frees memory associated with a ``struct gcv_context``.

|``struct gcv_filter``
|Stores characteristics of a filter.

|``struct gcv_opts``
|Store generic options applying to all filters.

|``gcv_opts_default()``
|Initialize a `struct gcv_opts` with default values.

|``gcv_list_filters()``
|Returns a pointer to a `const struct bu_ptbl` containing all registered filters as `const struct gcv_filter` pointers.

|``gcv_execute()``
|Perform a filter operation on a ``struct gcv_context``. Returns `1` on success and `0` on failure. If `gcv_options` is ``NULL``, the defaults will be used as set by ``gcv_opts_default()``. The parameters `argc` and `argv` are used for option parsing as specified by the struct gcv_filter.
|===

== The Internal Plugin API

The GCV plugin API is declared in ``include/gcv/api.h``.
Plugins provide an externally-visible `const struct gcv_plugin` defining their filters, which are described by ``struct gcv_filter``. 

.The gcv_filter struct
[cols="1,1", frame="none"]
|===
|``name``
|Specifies a unique name for the filter, allowing it to be identified by application code.

|``filter_type``
|Specifies the type of filter.

|``create_opts_fn``
|Optional pointer to a function that allocates and initializes `struct bu_opt_desc` data and an opaque pointer for storing the option data. If non-``NULL``, `free_opts_fn` must also be specified. This member is private for use by libgcv and the associated plugin. 

|``free_opts_fn``
|Optional pointer to a function that frees any opaque pointer allocated by ``create_opts_fn``. This member is private for use by libgcv and the associated plugin.

|``filter_fn``
|Pointer to a function which performs the filter operation. The `db_i` passed to a writer function within a `gcv_context` is marked read-only (the pointer is to a non-``const`` struct due to in-memory data that may be modified). Filters of type `GCV_FILTER_FILTER` receive a `NULL` value for ``target``. Must return `1` on success and `0` on failure. This member is private for use by libgcv and the associated plugin. 
|===

As shown in the above table, filters may initialize data structures for processing command-line style option strings via ``bu_opt``.
Please refer to `include/bu/opt.h` for full documentation on the `bu_opt` API. 

=== Utility Functions

In addition to availability of the rest of the BRL-CAD API, the Geometry Conversion Library provides a number of utility functions that may be useful during plugin development. 

.GCV utility functions
[cols="1,1", frame="none"]
|===
|``gcv_bot_is_solid()``, ``gcv_bot_is_closed()``, `gcv_bot_is_orientable()`
|Performs topological tests for determining whether a given triangular mesh is a manifold, orientable, closed fan satisfying requisite conditions for object solidity. `gcv_bot_is_solid()` is equivalent to `gcv_bot_is_closed && gcv_bot_is_orientable()`

|``gcv_facetize()``
|Produces a triangular mesh tessellation of the object at the given database path using the specified tolerances. Note that if the object at the given path is a combination, a single mesh will be produced from all objects within its tree, and so calling gcv_facetize() on a tree unnecessarily high in the hierarchy and containing many objects is more likely to fail during Boolean evaluation. 
|===

There are also many relevant functions provided by the BRL-CAD API, including a new mesh decimation function. 

.BRL-CAD mesh decimation API
[cols="1,1", frame="none"]
|===
|``rt_bot_decimate_gct()``
|Fast implementation of an iterative mesh decimation algorithm.
|===

== Developing a Minimal Plugin

=== Basic Code

The following steps will implement a minimal plugin providing a reader filter. 

. Add the following line to ``misc/mime_cad.types``. This file is used to generate ``include/bu/mime.h``: 
+

[source]
----

model/foo               bar
----
+
This will associate the file extension `$$.$$bar` with a new `BU_MIME_MODEL_FOO` value of ``bu_mime_model_t``. 
. Create the following file at ``src/libgcv/plugins/foo/CMakeLists.txt``: 
+

.CMakeLists.txt
====
[source]
----

LIBGCV_ADD_PLUGIN(foo "foo_read.c" "librt;libbu")
----
====
. Create the following file at ``src/libgcv/plugins/foo/foo_read.c``: 
+

.foo_read.c
[example]
TODO: embedded code 


=== Traversing the Database

BRL-CAD provides the `db_walk_tree()` function for traversing the database in hierarchical order.
You can specify your own visitor callbacks as documented in ``include/rt/tree.h``, or use the region-end functions provided by GCV (``include/gcv/util.h``) to tessellate geometry at the region level. 

.GCV region-end tessellation callbacks
[cols="1,1", frame="none"]
|===
|``gcv_region_end()``
|Apply Boolean evaluation to region-level tessellated meshes using the default NMG Boolean evaluator, replacing each region-level node and its subtree of tessellated leaf meshes with a single BoT structure that is then passed to the specified callback. The `client_data` pointer should point to a ``struct gcv_region_end_data``. The individual leaf nodes must already be tessellated into BoTs. This can be done by specifying a `leaf_func` such as ``nmg_booltree_leaf_tess()``. In the case of failure, an error message is emitted via `bu_log()` and the callback is not invoked. Any use of `bu_bomb()` produced by the callback is trapped and an error message is displayed while continuing the tree walk.

|``gcv_bottess_region_end()``
|Boolean evaluator roughly based on UnBBoolean's j3dbool (and associated papers). Does not take a callback.

|``gcv_region_end_mc()``
|Experimental variant of `gcv_region_end()` based on the marching-cubes algorithm. Tessellates leaves internally and does not require a ``leaf_func``. 
|===

The following example implements a filter that tessellates all geometry into BoT mesh objects and counts the total number of faces. 

.tessellation_statistics.c
[example]
TODO: embedded code 

=== Converting Unsupported Entities

Although BRL-CAD supports a wide array of common geometric primitives, you may encounter objects that can't be directly imported or exported into an analogous entity.
In these cases, conversion filters usually tessellate the incompatible geometry (typically during export) or convert it into an approximation or a composite of several other primitives (often during import). 

.Tessellation of incompatible entities

=== Comparing Geometry

When developing a filter, it is often useful to be able to compare different models during testing.
This capability is provided by the `gdiff` tool.
There are two versions of ``gdiff``: the standalone command-line version and the `gdiff` provided within the MGED interface. 

The command-line `gdiff` quickly produces a textual summary for a two- or three- way diff of several BRL-CAD databases.
Documentation for this utility is available under ``brlman gdiff``. 

The `gdiff` command available within the MGED interface provides a different capability.
It uses BRL-CAD's ray tracer to produce a visual display of the differences between two objects within the same database.
To compare geometry from separate databases, you can first merge the databases using the `dbconcat` command from within MGED.
See `brlman dbconcat` for full documentation. 

.Usage of MGED's gdiff utility
[cols="1,1", frame="none", options="header"]
|===
| Usage:
| gdiff [OPTION]... obj1 obj2

|``--tol=#``, `-t#`
|Tolerance in millimeters.

|``--ray-diff``, `-R`
|Test for differences with raytracing.

|``--view-left``, `-l`
|Visualize volumes added only by left object.

|``--view-both``, `-b`
|Visualize volumes common to both objects.

|``--view-right``, `-r`
|Visualize volumes added only by right object.

|``--grazing``, `-G`
|Report differences in grazing hits (raytracing mode).

=== Creating Unit Tests

BRL-CAD provides a library of standard models that may be used for unit tests, located under `$BRLCAD_ROOT/share/db/` (note that these files are generated during the build process). Unit tests can be integrated into the build system using the `add_test` CMake command. 

== Example: Extending an Application

The following example will leverage the filter in the above plugin example, ``tessellation_statistics.c``, to implement a function that counts the number of faces in a model after tessellation. 

.gcv_embedded.c
[example]

== The GCV Frontend

GCV includes a command-line front-end utility, ``gcv``, implemented in ``src/conv/gcv/gcv.c``.
Full documentation is available under `brlman gcv` and ``gcv --help``.

|
                Select which OBJ face grouping is used to create BRL-CAD primitives. 

`group` = group (default) 

`material` = material 

`none` = none 

`object` = object 

`texture` = texture 

|``--conversion-mode=[replaceable]``mode````
|
                Select the conversion mode. 

`bot` = native BoT (default) 

`nmg` = NMG 

`nmgbot` = BoT via NMG

`plate` = plate 

`nocos` = plate-nocos 

|``--bot-plot``
|Creates a plot/overlay (``$$.$$plot3``) file of open edges for BoTs that aren't closed volumes. `[replaceable]``bot_name``.plot3` will be created in the current directory and will overwrite any existing file with the same name.

|``--bot-orientation=[replaceable]``mode````
|
                Select the BoT orientation mode. 

`unoriented` = unoriented (default) 

`ccw` = counterclockwise

=== OBJ Writer

.OBJ writer options
[cols="1,1", frame="none"]
|===
|``--vertex-normals``
|Output vertex normals.

|``--usemtl``
|Place `usemtl` statements in the output file. These statements are fictional (they do not refer to any material database). The materials named provide information about the material codes assigned to the objects in the BRL-CAD database. The material names will be of the form "``[replaceable]``aircode``\_[replaceable]``los``\_[replaceable]``material````", where [replaceable]``aircode`` is the code number for the air represented by that region, if it does represent air; otherwise, this will be ``0``. The [replaceable]``los`` is the Line Of Sight thickness (``0`` to ``100``) assigned to the region, and [replaceable]``material`` is the material code number assigned. 
|===

=== STL Reader

.STL reader options
[cols="1,1", frame="none"]
|===
|``--binary``
|Specify that the input file is in binary STL format (the default assumes ASCII).

|``--starting-ident=[replaceable]``number````
|Specify the starting ident for the regions created. The default is ``1000``. This number will be incremented for each region, unless `--constant-ident` is specified.

|``--constant-ident``
|Specify that the starting ident should remain constant.

|``--material=[replaceable]``code````
|Specify the material code that will be assigned to all created regions (the default is ``1``).
|===

=== STL Writer

.STL writer options
[cols="1,1", frame="none"]
|===
|``--binary``
|Write output as a binary STL file. The default is ASCII. In the case of ASCII output, the region name is specified on the "solid" line of the STL file. In the case of binary output, all the regions are output as a single STL part.

|``--output-dir``
|Specify that the output path should be a directory. Each region converted is written to a separate file. File names are constructed from the full path names of each region (the path from the specified object to the region).  Any "``/``" characters in the path name are replaced by "``@``" characters and "``$$.$$``" and white space are replaced by "``\_``" characters.
