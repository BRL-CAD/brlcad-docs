== General

Though the U.S.  Army Ballistic Research Laboratory - Computer-Aided
Design (BRL-CAD) package has the capability to model highly detailed
and complex surfaces of objects, such as the multitude of small chips,
connectors, and other electrical components on a circuit board (see
Figure 1), individually building each piece of a complex surface is
often labor intensive, time consuming, and unnecessary for the model's
intended purpose.  Thus, the package offers an alternative, the
projection shader, to create realistic-looking "skin" for objects.

As its name implies, the projection shader projects an image onto a
surface.  Unlike the texture shader, however, which fits an image to
all available surfaces (stretching/shrinking as necessary), the
projection shader projects the image with user-defined dimensions and
orientations.

There are several ways that advanced users can implement and customize
the projection shader in BRL-CAD.  The average user can reduce the
complexity of the process, however, by complying with the following
three basic rules of thumb:

. the image to be projected should be square,
. the geometry window (minus the toolbar and borders) should be
square, and
. the projected image should exactly fill the framebuffer.

The following list identifies the basic tasks needed to use the
projection shader:

* create/obtain an image to project,
* resize the graphics display window or image so that their dimensions
  match each other,
* ensure the framebuffer is active,
* display the image in the framebuffer of the graphics display window,
* align the image on the geometry by modifying the view parameters,
* save the projection shader settings file,
* apply the shader settings file to the object in the combination
  editor, and
* render the image.

Each of these steps is discussed in the following paragraphs using the
example of the previously mentioned circuit board.

[[_projshader_getimage]]
== Create/Obtain an Image to Project

The first step in using the projection shader is to create or obtain
the image to be projected.  The image can be a pre-existing picture
file, or it can be created specifically for the projection.  In this
case, we took a photograph of the circuit board with a digital camera
and used a commercially available PC image editor to make the image
square.  When finished, we saved the image as a .jpg file, with the
name circuit_back_950.jpg.  (Note that it is wise to include the image
dimensions [i.e., 950 pixels wide × 950 pixels high] in the file name
because many projection shader tasks rely on them.) To get the image
into a BRL-CAD-accepted format (see tutorial box that follows), we
converted the .jpg file to a .png file using an image editor and then
the .png file to a .pix file using the BRL-CAD png-pix utility.  For
more information on this utility, consult the man page.

[NOTE]
====
BRL-CAD recognizes several image file formats, including .pix, .png.,
and .ppm.  Because the package relies on precise color values to
perform certain calculations, it does not support lossy file formats
(e.g., .jpg), which are based on algorithms that can alter or lose
image/color data.
====

[[_projshader_resize]]
== Resize the Graphics Display Window to Match Image Dimensions

The next step is to "prepare" the area on which the image will be
displayed so that it is ready for the image.  For the circuit board,
the size of the photograph was 950 pixels × 950 pixels high.  To make
the graphics display window match, we opened the Raytrace Control
Panel and used the numbers in the Size window box as a reference to
determine how much to enlarge/shrink the graphics display window (by
using the mouse to drag the window borders in or out) (see Figure
2).

.Using the Raytrace Control Panel to size the graphics window.

[NOTE]
====
Note that the Raytrace Control Panel (specifically, the Size field) is
used here simply to report the result of the user scaling the
dimensions of the graphics display area.  It is not used to set the
desired dimensions (in this case, 950 × 950) of the graphics area by
inputting them into the Size field.  Any numbers input into this field
will only determine the size of the display area in the next raytrace.

Also note that some window managers have information boxes that
automatically report the size of the graphics display window as it is
being enlarged/reduced; however, the dimensions reported in these
boxes often represent the size of the entire window (including
toolbars, borders, etc.) and not the size of the framebuffer.
====

[[_projshader_actframe]]
== Ensure the Framebuffer is Active

A small but sometimes overlooked step before displaying any image onto
the graphics display window is to make sure the framebuffer is active.
If it is not active, it may appear that nothing happens when a display
command is given.  There are several ways to check the status of the
framebuffer.  We went to the Settings pull-down menu in the graphical
user interface, selected Framebuffer, and made sure the box next to
the Framebuffer Active option was toggled on.

[[_projshader_dispimage]]
== Display the Image in the Graphics Display Window

After the graphics display window has been prepared and the
framebuffer checked/set, the image can be displayed in the graphics
window.  To do this, we entered the following command:

[cmd]`pix-fb -F0 -s 950 circuit_back_950.pix`

Diagrammed, the command breaks down as follows: 

[%header, cols="5*~", frame="all"]
|===
|pix-fb
|-F0
|-s
|950
|circuit_back_950.pix

|Send a .pix file to a framebuffer.
|Use framebuffer number 0.
|Make it a square image.
|950 pixels wide and high.
|Use the image file named circuit_back_950.pix
|===

For more information on the pix-fb command (including a list of other
options the command takes), type pix-fb on the command line or consult
the man page.

[NOTE]
====
Note that framebuffers use transmission control protocol (TCP) ports
for applications.  The framebuffer number that follows the -F option
specifies an offset from the TCP port number.  Framebuffer 0 is on
port 5558.  If 0 is already in use, the Multi-Device Geometry Editor
(MGED) will use the next available framebuffer number (e.g., 1, 2, 3,
etc.). To determine which port MGED is actually using, type "set port"
from the MGED command prompt.
====

[[_projshader_overlayimage]]
== Overlay the Image on the Geometry by Modifying the View Parameters

With the image and the target geometry displayed, edit the view
parameters so that the image is aligned with the geometry on which it
is to be projected.  In our case, we used the Shift-Grips to scale and
translate and the ae command to adjust the azimuth, elevation, and
twist of the circuit board wireframe so that its outside edges lined
up with the outside edges of the projected image (see Figure
B-3). (For a refresher on the functionality of the Shift-Grips,
consult chapter 2, Volume II, of the BRL-CAD Tutorial Series.)

[[_projshader_savesettingsfile]]
== Save the Projection Shader Settings File

After the geometry and image have been aligned, the projection
settings (i.e., image file name, image width, image height, and
current view parameters) can then be saved to a file using the prj_add
command.  The prj_add command appends the image file name and the
current view parameters to the shader file.  In our case, the command
was:

[cmd]`prj_add circuitboard.prj circuit_back_950.pix 950 950`

Diagrammed, this command breaks down as follows: 

[%header, cols="5*~", frame="all"]
|===
|prj_add
|circuitboard.prj
|circuit_back_950.pix
|950
|950

|Add the projection file name and parameters to the shader.
|Name the shader circuitboard.prj
|Use image file circuit_back_950.pix
|Make the image 950 pixels wide.
|Make the image 950 pixels high.
|===

[[_projshader_applysettingsfile]]
== Apply the Shader Settings File to the Object in the Combination Editor

The projection now needs to be applied to the object.  We did this by
opening the combination editor, typing in the region name cir.r1 in
the Name field, and selecting Projection from the pull-down menu to
the right of the Shader field.  We then typed circuitboard.prj in the
Parameter File field and pressed Apply (see Figure 4).  Note that
when the name of the shader file is typed into the Parameter File
field, the same information is echoed into the Shader field.

[[_projshader_render]]
== Render the Image

The final step in using the projection shader is to raytrace the
object to determine if all the other steps have been performed
correctly.  In our case, rendering the image identified several
problems that we wanted to correct.  First of all, as shown in Figure
B-5, the holes in the board failed to convey the three-dimensional
look we desired.  So, we went back and modeled circular cutouts (using
cylinder primitives) to improve the appearance.  In addition, the
rendered image revealed that the image we were using was too dark.
So, we ended up adjusting the gamma setting on the original image
(a .jpg file) in an external photo editor.

[[_projshader_projectfront]]
== Repeating the Steps to Project the Image on the Front

After one side of the circuit board was finished, we proceeded to
repeat the steps to add more projection parameters to the .prj file
and thus project a different image onto the front side of the geometry
(see Figure 6). To do this, we once again had to acquire an image,
properly size the geometry window, display the image and the geometry
to the geometry window, and set up view parameters.  After this was
done, these parameters could be added to the existing .prj file by
typing the following:

[cmd]`prj_add circuitboard.prj circuit_front_950.pix 950 950`

projection is on top and the second projection is on the bottom.)
