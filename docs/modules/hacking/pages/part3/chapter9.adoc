= Contributing Documentation

Before undertaking a documentation task, you should join the BRL-CAD
http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/brlcad-devel[developer
mailing list]
(http://lists.sourceforge.net/lists/listinfo/brlcad-devel) and the
#brlcad IRC channel irc.freenode.net.

Joining both lists helps introduce you the the BRL-CAD community and
gives you the opportunity to regularly communicate with other
experienced contributors.  You can also ask questions on the mailing
list or the IRC channel.

BRL-CAD contributors have a set of rules that they try to respect and
follow to enable collaboration and communication.  We strongly
encourage new contributors to be creative and to be specific when
asking questions on the mailing list or on the IRC channel.  We also
strongly advise you to use interleaved posting when replying on any
communication channels.  And once again, __don't be afraid to ask
questions__.
