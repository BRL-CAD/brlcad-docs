.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBpixhist3d\fP builds up a count of color frequencies in the RGB
color space and then displays three orthographic views of this color
space. An RGB color cube with red, green, and blue values from 0 to
255 form a right handed coordinate system.  Three faces of this cube
are displayed where the intensity of the pixels shown for each face
correspond to the integrated frequencies through the color cube
perpendicular to that face.  These frequencies are scaled so that the
maximum value is full white, and any non\-zero scaled count less than
30 is displayed at intensity 30 so as to be visible.

The faces are:

The environment variable \f(CRFB_FILE\fP is used to select the display
device (see \fBbrlcad\fP(1)). If this variable is
not set, the default device for your system will be used.
