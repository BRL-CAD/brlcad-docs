= 14. Additional Exercises Placing Shapes in 3-D Space
:sectnums:
:experimental:

In this lesson, you will:

* Create copies of a shape using the Primitive Editor.
* Draw a grid to help position objects.
* Check the data tree and make corrections (if needed).
* Assign material properties using the Combination Editor.

In previous lessons, we created and edited shapes and placed objects
in 3-D space.  This lesson provides more advanced practice in these
areas using the candle design you created in the last lesson.

Open the candle.g database if it isn't already open and draw
candle1.c.

[[_candle_base_1st_sphere]]
== Making the First Sphere

Using the GUI, create a sphere named sph1.s.  Go to the View menu and
select Top view.  Go to the Edit menu, select Scale, and size the
sphere until it is proportionally about the same size as the one in
the following illustration:

.Sphere Placed on Candle Base from Top View

[[_draw_grid_feature]]
== Using the Draw Grid Feature

Drag the sphere into position on the rcc, as shown in the previous
illustration.  To make this task a little easier, you can go to the
Modes menu and select Draw Grid.  This will create a grid overlay in
the Graphics Window, which can help you position your spheres on the
candle base.

[[_multipane_feature]]
== Using the Multipane Feature

As discussed earlier, another feature that is available to help you
position each sphere is the Multipane option under the Modes menu.
This will allow you to see multiple views of the design you are
creating.

.Multipane Feature
image::mged/14_candle_multipane.png[]

As you move a shape, the change in position will be reflected in each
pane.  The multipanes help you visualize where the shape is in 3-D
space.  In the default mode, the top left pane shows the top view, the
top right pane shows the current view, the bottom left pane shows the
front view, and the bottom right pane shows the left view.  To turn
off either the grid or the multipane functions, go back to Modes and
select the feature you want to disable.

[[_copies_of_shapes]]
== Creating Copies of a Shape

To make more jewels for the base, you could use the copy command on
the Command Line (cp sph1.s sph2.s), but another way to do this is to
go to the Edit menu and select Primitive Editor.  Type sph1.s in the
text box to the right of Name.  Click on Reset and then change the
name to sph2.s and click Apply.  Continue doing this until you've made
eight jewels.  Because each of the new spheres is an exact copy of the
first sphere, you won't be able to see them until you select and then
move them.

.The Primitive Editor Dialog Box
image::mged/14_primitive_editor.png[]

To position your new spheres, go to Primitive Selection.  A submenu of
shapes you have created will drop down.  Use the scrollbar to the
right of the list of shapes to access the spheres you have created, as
shown in the following illustration.

.Drop-Down Menu of Primitives Available Through Primitive Selection
image::mged/14_primitive_selection_dropdown.png[]

Click on sph2.s and drag it into position.  Once you have positioned
the eight spheres around the rcc, your design should look similar to
the following ones when viewed from the top and front.

[cols="1,1"]
|===

|image:mged/14_candle_spheres_topview.png[]
|image:mged/14_candle_spheres_frontview.png[]

|Candle from Top View
|Candle from Front View
|===

Notice from the front view that there appears to only be five spheres
around the base of the candle, but there are eight spheres when you
view the design from the top.  That is because you are viewing 3-D
space on a 2-D screen and the spheres in the back are behind the ones
in the front.  If you change the view to an az35, el25 view, all of
the spheres will appear, as shown in the following figure.  This is
one reason why it is important to continually check your design from
multiple views.  A mistake in placement that doesn't appear from one
view may be very noticeable from another view.

[[_practice_make_regions_spheres]]
== Making Regions of the Spheres

Now that all your spheres are made and in place, it is time to make a
region of each sphere.  To do this, type the following in the Command
Window:


[subs="quotes,macros"]
....
[cmd]`r sph1.r u sph1.s kbd:[Enter]`
[cmd]`r sph2.r u sph2.s kbd:[Enter]`
[cmd]`r sph3.r u sph3.s kbd:[Enter]`
[cmd]`r sph4.r u sph4.s kbd:[Enter]`
[cmd]`r sph5.r u sph5.s kbd:[Enter]`
[cmd]`r sph6.r u sph6.s kbd:[Enter]`
[cmd]`r sph7.r usph7.s kbd:[Enter]`
[cmd]`r sph8.r u sph8.s kbd:[Enter]`
....

[NOTE]
====
There are three easier ways to make all of the regions.  The first
involves typing the first command:

[cmd]`r sph1.r u sph1.s kbd:[Enter]`

and then using the up arrow to recall this command.  Now use the left
arrow to move backward in the Command Line to replace both occurrences
of the number "1" with "2" and press ENTER.  Repeat this for each of
the numbers 3 through 8.

The second approach is based upon the fact that the Command Line
interpreter of [app]`MGED` uses the Tcl/Tk language.  This gives us
access to some convenient loop commands.  The following will make all
of the regions for us in a single command:

[cmd]`foreach i { 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 } { kbd:[Enter]`

[cmd]`r sph$i.r u sph$i.s kbd:[Enter]`

[cmd]`} kbd:[Enter]`

This is much easier and faster than either of the previous methods.
However, if there were many more spheres (say 1000 or more), then it
might be easier to use a third approach, which employs a different
loop type:

[subs="macros"]
....
    for {set i 1} {i <= 1000} {incr i} { kbd:[Enter]
      r sph$i.r u sph$i.s kbd:[Enter]
    }
....
====

Next, go to Edit and then Combination Editor.  Select sph1.r from the
Select From All choice in the pull-down menu to the right of the Name
entry box.  Assign properties of plastic and the color red and then
press Apply.  We then can go back to the Select From All menu listing
and repeat this process for the other seven spheres.  Alternatively,
we could use Apply after selecting the appropriate material properties
and then type in the next sphere's name; however, this method requires
the user to remember to update the Boolean Expression box (e.g.,
change u sph1.s to u sph2.s) so that the Booleans for one shape are
not applied to another shape.

[NOTE]
====
Once again, we are performing the same operation multiple times.  This
is another good opportunity to use a loop.

[cmd]`foreach i { 1 2 3 4 5 6 78 } { kbd:[Enter]`

[cmd]`mater sph$i.r "plastic" 255 0 0 0 kbd:[Enter]`

[cmd]`} kbd:[Enter]`

In general, the graphical interface is good for doing one thing at a
time or doing highly visual operations.  Repetitive operations are
best performed using a Command Line interface.
====

[[_candle_base_spheres_combine]]
== Combining the Spheres with the Candle Base

We are now faced with an important decision.  At the moment, the
jewels overlap a portion of the candle base (specifically, the rcc1.s
portion). Because two objects cannot occupy the same space, we must
decide how to resolve this situation.  There are two choices:

* We can have perfectly round jewels with dents in the side of the
  candle base where the jewels are mounted.
* We can have a perfectly round base with a cylindrical bite taken out
  of the back of each jewel.

For this lesson, we will use the first choice.

Now we are faced with a second decision: how to achieve this result.
The key is that the space the jewels occupy must be subtracted from
the correct part (rcc1.s) of the base.

On the Command Line, create rcc1.c by typing:

[cmd]`comb rcc1.c u rcc1.s - sph1.r - sph2.r - sph3.r - sph4.r - sph5.r - sph6.r - sph7.r - sph8.r kbd:[Enter]`

Next, bring up the Combination Editor and select
base1.r.  Change the union of rcc1.s in the Boolean Expression window
to a union of rcc1.c, and click OK.  The tree of base1.r should now
look like:

....
   u base1.r/R
     u eto1.s
     u rcc1.c
       u rcc1.s
       - sph1.r/R
         u sph1.s
       - sph2.r/R
         u sph2.s
       - sph3.r/R
         u sph3.s
       - sph4.r/R
         u sph4.s
       - sph5.r/R
         u sph5.s
       - sph6.r/R
         u sph6.s
       - sph7.r/R
         u sph7.s
       - sph8.r/R
         u sph8.s
     u eto2.s
     - rcc2.s
....

[NOTE]
====
Note that we could have achieved the same results on the Command Line
by using the rm (remove) command to remove rcc1.s from base1.r and
then adding rcc1.c:

[cmd]`rm base1.r rcc1.s kbd:[Enter]`

[cmd]`r base1.r u rcc1.c kbd:[Enter]`

This would have resulted in a very similar tree as above:

....
    u base1.r/R
      u eto1.s
      u eto2.s
      - rcc2.s
      u rcc1.c
        u rcc1.s
        - sph1.r/R
          u sph1.s
        - sph2.r/R
          u sph2.s
        - sph3.r/R
          u sph3.s
        - sph4.r/R
          u sph4.s
        - sph5.r/R
          u sph5.s
        - sph6.r/R
          u sph6.s
        - sph7.r/R
          u sph7.s
        - sph8.r/R
          u sph8.s
....

Finally, we could have avoided making an intermediate object in the
database by moving rcc1.s to the end of the Boolean equation for
base1.r and then subtracting each of the jewels from base1.r (hence,
removing material from rcc1.s). This would have resulted in:

....
    u base1.r/R
      u eto1.s
      u eto2.s
      - rcc2.s
      u rcc1.s
      - sph1.r/R
        u sph1.s
      - sph2.r/R
        u sph2.s
      - sph3.r/R
        u sph3.s
      - sph4.r/R
        u sph4.s
      - sph5.r/R
        u sph5.s
      - sph6.r/R
        u sph6.s
      - sph7.r/R
        u sph7.s
      - sph8.r/R
        u sph8.s
....

It would be good practice to consider the relative merits of each of
the approaches discussed.
====

Now we need to add the jewels to the whole of candle1.c:

[cmd]`comb candle1.c u sph1.r u sph2.r u sph3.r u sph4.r u sph5.r u sph6.r u sph7.r u sph8.r kbd:[Enter]`

There are just a couple of things left to do before you raytrace your
design.  If you have enabled Multipanes or Draw Grid, go back to the
Modes menu and disable them.  Then, clear your screen and draw your
new design by typing in the Command Window:

[cmd]`B candle1.c table1.r`

Your new design should appear in the Graphics Window.  Open the
Raytrace Control Panel and select a pale blue color (200 236 242) by
typing the three values in the Background Color entry box.  When you
raytrace your design, it should look similar to the following one:
