.SH "NAME"
window_frame \- Creates a BRL\-CAD .g file containing window frames.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBwindow_frame\fP [\fIoptions\fP]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBwindow_frame\fP is a program to create a BRL\-CAD database of
window frames with rounded corners.  Up to twenty\-six windows of the
same size may be created.  The windows are made with rounded
corners. \fBwindow_frame\fP uses libwdb to create a BRL\-CAD database.
The window frames are composed of four arb8s and eight cylinders.
This program may be run interactively or the user may specify options
on a command line.  If the user chooses to run the program
interactively, he answers the questions as the program prompts him.
Below are the options that can be used on the command line.

The window frames are composed of 4 arb8s and 8
cylinders.  The front of the window frame is centered
at (0, 0, 0) and extends in the negative x\-direction
the depth of the window frame.

Both of these examples create a database named win.frm.g containing
three window frames with a height of 200mm, width of 300mm, depth of
20mm, and corner radius of 30mm. The actual width of the frame itself
is 10mm.
