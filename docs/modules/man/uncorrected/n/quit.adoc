== NAME

quit - Ends the MGED process.
   

== SYNOPSIS

*quit*

== DESCRIPTION

Ends the MGED process. Note that there is no write database command in MGED. All changes are made to the database as the user performs them. Therefore, a [cmd]*quit* command will not restore the database to its pre-edited state. This is a synonym for the [cmd]*q* command. 

== EXAMPLES

The example shows the use of the [cmd]*quit* command to end the current MGED session. 

.End the current MGED session.
====
[prompt]#mged>#[ui]`quit`

Quits the current MGED session.
