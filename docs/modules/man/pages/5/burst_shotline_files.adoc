== NAME

burst_shotline_files - Data output by the shotline-file command from the burst tool.


== FORMAT

Burst shotline files are composed of single-line records. Each line begins with a digit that identifies the type of record it represents. The file is composed of one or more runs that begin with a run header. Each shotline that intersects the target will result in a shotline header that is followed by one or more shotline intersection records.
