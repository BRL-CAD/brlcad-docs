== NAME

mged - multi-display interactive combinatorial solid geometry editor

== SYNOPSIS

*mged* [-a attach] [-b] [-c] [-d display] [-h|?] [-r] [-x#] [-X#] [-v] [_database.g_] [_mged_command_]

== DESCRIPTION

[app]`MGED`, a.k.a. the "Multi-Device Geometry Editor", is the central
interaction environment for the BRL-CAD package.  It offers both
command line and menu driven interactions, as well as wireframe
displays and integrated raytracing capabilities.  It is the primary
tool for BRL-CAD geometry creation and interactive manipulation.

[app]``MGED``'s history traces back to the earlier "GED"
(a.k.a. "Geometry Editor"), and much of GED's functionality is
preserved in [app]`MGED`. A full description of MGED's abilities is
beyond the scope of this document - the reader is referred to Volumes
II and III of the BRL-CAD Tutorial Series, available at
http://brlcad.org, for a more comprehensive introduction.  This
document will deal with the various options available when it comes to
starting MGED.

The primary mode for modern [app]`MGED` usage is the Tcl/Tk based
environment, which offers menu support and a number of Tcl based
tools.  It is also possible to run more minimalist environments of
terminal \+ framebuffer and a terminal without any display
window. [app]`MGED` also allows users to execute single commands from
the command line without starting any environment, allowing for
activities such as scripting.  Some examples of such usage are present
in the Examples section of this document.

Technically, [app]`MGED` can be opened without a database file being
supplied, but until one _is_ supplied it will not be terribly
useful. This can be done either by supplying a file name on the
command line or by opening a database from within [app]`MGED` using
the File->Open... menu or the [cmd]*opendb* command.

*-a attach*:: The [opt]*-a* option specifies a display manager to
automatically attach to when starting [app]`MGED`.
+
Without specifying the [opt]*-a* attach option, [app]`MGED` will
prompt which display manager to attach during startup: [prompt]#attach
(nu|X|ogl)[nu]?#
+
The list of available display managers varies from platform to
platform and across releases.  However, some commonly available
options are the _nu_ (NULL) display manager, which will start
[app]`MGED` without any display manager attached; the _X_ display
manager, which provides an X11 graphical wireframe display; and the
_ogl_ display manager, which is similar to _X_ but starts up a display
manager that uses the OpenGL protocol for drawing wireframes.

*-b*:: Supplying the [opt]*-b* to [cmd]*mged* will result in
[app]`MGED` being started as a background process.  This is handy if
the users still wishes to make use of the terminal from which
[app]`MGED` is being started.

*-c*:: Instructs [app]`MGED` to start using classic mode instead of
the default Tcl/Tk-based GUI.  The [opt]*-c* option is often used when
specifying an [opt]*mged_command* to indicate that [app]`MGED` is
being run in a command-mode without a default GUI.  Example:
[cmd]*mged* [opt]*-c* db/moss.g tops

*-d display*:: The [opt]*-d* option to [app]`MGED` specifies which X
server to connect to for platforms that have a running X11 server
available.  This option is an analogous alternative to setting the
DISPLAY environment variable.  You can specify a local or remote
display in X11 HOST:PORT format (e.g., "-d :0" or "-d host:0") and
[app]`MGED` should draw windows to that display.

*-h* or *-?*:: Prints out a brief help statement showing the options
available when starting [app]`MGED`.

*-r*:: Opens the database.g file in read-only mode.

*-x #*:: Specify the debug level of librt.

*-X #*:: Specify the debug level of libbu.

*-v*:: Display the version and exit.

[[_scripting]]
== SCRIPTING (BATCHING) MGED

Often it is convenient to generate a series of [app]`MGED` commands
outside [app]`MGED` and then submit the command list to [app]`MGED`,
which will react as if each command were being manually entered
within it. Simply create a file (say, "cmds.txt") with each line being
a desired command, and then have [app]`MGED` execute the list.  At the
normal shell prompt, execute

  $ mged -c tgm.g < cmds.txt

Note that the procedure described above is very useful in rapid
prototyping or automated TGM processing without resorting to low-level
library programming in C or C++.

== HINTS

[app]`MGED` database names conventionally end with *.g*. 

SIGINT aborts the current command. 

"q" or EOF exits the program. 

The ".mgedrc" file is searched for in three places. The first one
found is used, and any others are ignored.

[loweralpha]
. If the environment variable MGED_RCFILE is set, it is used as a path
name for the file to be used.
. If the environment variable HOME is set, then HOME/.mgedrc is used.
. If the file ".mgedrc" exists in the current directory, it is used.


== EXAMPLES

The following are run from the operating system command prompt:
