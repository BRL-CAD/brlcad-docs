= Modeling the Chess Set
:sectnums:

== Chessboard

In this lesson, we are going to model the chessboard. Given below is
our target design:

image::09-chessboard.jpg[]

Create a new database name [path]`chess.g`

`[in]#opendb chess.g#` kbd:[ENTER]


== Assigning a title to your database

In the MGED command window, type [cmd]`title` followed by the title of
your database justifying what you are making. Press kbd:[Enter] at the
end.

`[prompt]#mged># [in]#title Chess#` kbd:[ENTER]

== Creating a single tile for the chessboard

Before beginning, make sure that MGED Command Window is active
(by clicking anywhere in the window). Then type in the command:

`[in]#in tile.s1 rpp 0 1 0 1 -0.1 0#`

image::47-tile.jpg[]


== Making a region of the tile

Type in the MGED prompt:

`[in]#r tile.r1 u tile.s1#`

This command makes a region with the name `tile.r1`

== Understanding the clone command

Let’s understand the clone command first.  This command is used to do
deep copying in MGED. The syntax for this command is:

`[cmd]#clone# +++[+++[opt]#-abhimnprtv#] <object>`

Here each one of the `+++[+++[opt]#-abhimnprtv#]` have a specific
meaning to it. Let’s better understand this command using examples.

Create a demo database by typing `[in]#mged demo.g#` in the command
prompt. Then, create a sphere using the [cmd]`in` command as follows:

`[in]#in tile.s1 rpp 0 1 0 1 -0.1 0#` kbd:[ENTER]

Option `[opt]#-a# <n> <x> <y> <z>` specifies the translation split
dimensions between n clones.  Type,

`[in]#clone -a 2 0 0 3 tile.#` kbd:[ENTER]

MGED will show this:

....
tile.s101 {tile.s101 tile.s201}
....

This means, you have got two clones separated by distance 3
units on the **z**-axis. To visually verify it, type:

`[in]#draw tile.s101 tile.s2#` kbd:[ENTER]

image::48-tile-translation-clones.jpg[]

Option `[opt]#-b# <n> <x> <y> <z>` specifies a rotation around the
*x*, *y* and *z* axes split between *n* copies.

Example: Type `[in]#Z#` on the MGED command prompt to clear the
graphic window.
Then type,

[subs="+quotes"]
....
[prompt]#mged># [in]#draw tile.s1#
[prompt]#mged># [in]#clone -b 2 0 180 0 tile.s1#
tile.s301 {tile.301 tile.401}
....

image::49-tile-rotation-clones.jpg[]

You see that the cloned tiles are separated from each other by an
angle of 180 along the *y* axis.

* [opt]`-c` -- Increment the second number in object names.
* [opt]`-f` -- Don’t draw the new object.
* [opt]`-g` -- Don’t resize the view after drawing new objects.
* [opt]`-h` -- Prints the message.
* `[opt]#-i# <n>` -- Specifies the increment between each copy.
* `[opt]#-m# <axis> <pos>` -- Specifies the axis and point to mirror
  the group.
* `[opt]#-n# <+++#+++ copies>` -- Specifies the copies you make.
* `[opt]#-p# <x> <y> <z>` -- Specifies point to rotate around for
  [opt]`-r`. Default is `0 0 0`.
* `[opt]#-r# <x> <y> <z>` -- Specifies the rotation around *x*, *y*
  and *z* axes. It works same as [opt]`-b` when combined with
  [opt]`-n`.
* `[opt]#-t# <x> <y> <z>` -- Specifies the translation between each
  copy. It works same as [opt]`-a` when combined with `n`.
* [opt]`-v` -- Prints version info.

== Cloning the tile for three other tiles

Coming back to our chessboard, let’s clone the tile we made earlier.
Now, type:

`[in]#clone -t 2 0 0 -i 1 -n 3 tile.r1#` kbd:[ENTER]

MGED will respond with:

....
tile.r2 {tile.s2 tile.s3 tile.s4 tile.r2 tile.r3 tile.r4}
....

This command translates the first clone `tile.r2` at `x:2 y:0 z:0`
(leaving a gap of 1 unit) and then increments it value by 1 for the
next clone. `[opt]#-n# 3` specifies that it creates three clones
(`tile.r2 tile.r3 tile.r4`)

This command successfully creates single colored tiles of a row. Till
now, you can only see one tile in the graphics window, to see all the
clone, type:

`[in]#draw tile.r2 tile.r3 tile.r4#` kbd:[ENTER]

Left click on the graphic window for all the tiles to fit in the
graphics window.

== Grouping the tiles in a row

Let’s group these tiles in one row:

`[in]#g row.g1 tile.r1 tile.r2 tile.r3 tile.r4#` kbd:[ENTER]


== Creating an alternate row by cloning

To get the tiles in alternate position as present in the above
screenshot, we will clone this row and translate it to `x:1 y:1 z:0`,
as shown below:

`[in]#clone -t 1 1 0 -i 1 row.g1#` kbd:[ENTER]

MGED will respond with:

....
row.g2 {tile.s5 tile.r5 tile.s6 tile.r6 tile.s7 tile.r7
tile.s8 tile.r8 row.g2}
....

Type `[in]#draw row.g2#` kbd:[ENTER] in the command prompt to view the
`row.g2`:

image::51-two-rows-of-tiles.jpg[]

There are total 8 rows in a chess board, so we will have 3 clones each
of `row.g1` and `row.g2`


== Making the remaining rows

Now, we will be translating along the *y* axis, therefore the command
will be:

`[in]#clone -t 0 2 0 -i 1 -n 3 row.g1#` kbd:[ENTER]

And for `row.g2`

`[in]#clone -t 0 2 0 -i 1 -n 3 row.g2#` kbd:[ENTER]

You will get `row.g3` , `row.g4` , `row.g5` clones of `row.g1` and
clones `row.g6` , `row.g7` , `row.g8` of `row.g2`.

You can view these rows by using the draw command:

`[in]#draw row.g3 row.g4 row.g5 row.g6 row.g7 row.g8#` kbd:[ENTER]

image::52-all-alternate-tiles.jpg[]

You see that here we only have alternate tiles i.e., tiles of one
color.  Let’s group them together under one name `black.g` as shown
below:

`[in]#g black.g row.g1 row.g2 row.g3 row.g4 row.g5 row.g6 row.g7
row.g8#` kbd:[ENTER]

Now, in order to make the white tiles we will clone the group of black
tiles `black.g` , as shown below:

`[in]#clone -r 0 0 90 -p 4 4 0 black.g#` kbd:[ENTER]


We will get a clone with the name `black.g2`. We can change the name
of this group to `white.g` using the [cmd]`mv` command.

`[in]#mv black.g2 white.g#` kbd:[ENTER]


Now, let’s have a look at the rest of our slides by typing `[in]#draw
white.g#`

== Giving colors to our tiles

In this section we will color our tiles using the [cmd]`comb_color` command
which means combination color i.e. color of the whole
combination/group. The syntax to use this command is:

`[cmd]#comb_color# _combination_ _R_ _G_ _B_`

Where `combination` is the name of the combination we want to color.
`R`, `G` and `B` are the red, green and blue values respectively.

To color the black tiles:

`[in]#comb_color black.g 0 0 0#` kbd:[ENTER]

To color the white tiles:

`[in]#comb_color white.g 255 255 255#` kbd:[ENTER]

Now combine these black and white tiles to form a board.

`[in]#g board.g black.g white.g#` kbd:[ENTER]

And then comes the final part, which is to raytrace our chessboard.
Before we raytrace, move the mouse pointer to the Command Prompt and
type at the prompt:

`[in]#B board.g#` kbd:[ENTER]

This command clears the screen and redraws the board with the
specified colors.

== Raytracing the Board

Go to the *File* menu and select *Raytrace*. The Raytrace Control
Panel opens. To have a lighter background, click on the dropdown
button on the right of *Background Color*.  Click on *Raytrace* to
start the raytracing process.

While it is raytracing, click on the Framebuffer options in the
_Raytrace Control Panel Menu Bar_ and click on *Overlay*.

After the raytracing process is completed, you get a board, as shown
below:
