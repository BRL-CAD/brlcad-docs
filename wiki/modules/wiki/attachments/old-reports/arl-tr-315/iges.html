<TITLE>IGES 4.0 to BRL-CAD Translator for CSG Models</TITLE>
<H2>IGES</H2>
One might ask that if translators between CAD system A 
and B were required, then why not produce those direct 
translators instead of using the neutral file format scheme of IGES?  
For a small number of CAD systems that solution may be reasonable, 
but consider how many translators would be needed for exchange between 
a large number of systems.  For each and every pair of CAD systems 
two translators are required, one for each direction (i.e., one to 
produce the data file and another to read the data file).  The number 
of translators required for full exchange capability among a group 
of n CAD systems is <EM>n x ( n - 1 )</EM>.
The number of translators required for a data exchange via IGES is 
simply <EM>2n</EM>,
because every CAD system requires just two translators (one for incoming 
and one for outgoing).  Note that the number of IGES translators required 
for the IGES scheme increases only linearly with the number of CAD 
systems, while the number required for direct translation increases 
as the square of the number of CAD systems.<P>
Nearly every CAD system on the market today supports exchange 
of two-dimensional drawings via IGES.  An example of a drawing received 
at ARL in IGES format is shown in figure 1. <A HREF="ref.html#IGES[7]"><STRONG>IGES[7]</STRONG></A><P>

Although the IGES form of that drawing has no direct application 
to generating a solid model of the helicopter in the <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> system, 
it must be noted that the IGES file does contain data suitable for 
capture by a preprocessor that could simplify the making of the solid 
model.  Work is in progress with just that objective; however, that 
exploitation of IGES is beyond the scope of this report.<P>
The IGES specification defines a neutral file format for the 
exchange of product definition data.  This neutral file may be in 
one of three formats:  ASCII, compressed ASCII, or binary.  The ASCII 
form is the most commonly used and is the only form considered in 
this report.  This format is based on fixed-length 80-character records.  
The ASCII file format consists of five sections, a start section, 
a global section, a directory section, a parameter section, and a 
terminate section.  Figure 2 shows an example of an ASCII format IGES 
file.<P>

The start section is merely a place for any human-readable comments 
that the sender wishes to include.  The global section contains information 
for use by the post-processor (receiving translator) such as the units 
used in the IGES file, a scale factor, the date the file was generated, 
the sender's name, and so forth.  The actual data in the IGES file 
are recorded as a number of entities.  Each entity 
has a specific purpose and a specific format within the file.  Each 
entity must have its own entry in the directory section.  Directory 
section entries consist of two 80-character records that contain 
information about that particular entity such as what type of entity 
it is, whether this entity requires a transformation matrix applied 
to it (and where the directory entry for the matrix can be found), 
the form number (if required), the color of the object, and where 
the parameters that define this entity are located.  The pointers 
in the directory section that indicate where other data are to be 
found are simply sequence numbers (literally, line numbers) usually 
in the parameter section.  The parameter section contains the detailed 
data for each entity in a free-form style with each field separated 
by an end-of-field delimiter and each record terminated with an end-of-record 
delimiter.  Both these delimiters are defined in the global section.  
The parameter section is followed by the terminate section which consists 
of a single 80-character record containing the number of records used 
for each section of the file.<P>
IGES supports the following entities for a CSG solid model
<OL>
<LI>Block
<LI>Right Angular Wedge
<LI>Right Circular Cylinder
<LI>Right Circular Cone Frustum
<LI>Sphere
<LI>Torus
<LI>Ellipsoid
<LI>Solid of Revolution
<LI>Solid of Linear Extrusion
<LI>Solid Instance
<LI>Boolean Tree
<LI>Solid Assembly
</OL>
The first seven of these entity types are simple primitive shapes, 
and the directory section entry for each would contain a pointer to 
a parameter section entry that contains data such as vertices, radii, 
length vectors, and so forth.  The parameter section entry 
for the solid of revolution would contain a pointer to another directory 
entry for some type of curve definition entity as well as a point, 
axis, and a rotation angle.  The curve is rotated about the axis through 
the rotation angle to generate (define) the solid.  The solid of linear 
extrusion specifies a closed curve (representing the cross section 
of the extrusion) and a vector to define the direction and distance 
the cross section is to be extruded.<P>
Both the solid of revolution and the solid of linear extrusion 
may make use of any of the IGES curve entities.  These curves may 
be specified using any of the following entity types:
<OL>
<LI>Circular Arc
<LI>Conic Arc
<LI>Line
<LI>Copious Data
<LI>Parametric Spline
<LI>Rational B-Spline
<LI>Composite Curve
</OL>
The first three of these are obvious curve types.  The copious data 
curve is merely a series of data points to be connected by straight 
lines.  The splines offer two types of smooth curves, and the composite 
curve is a single curve with a series of segments made up of any mix 
of the above curve types (including more composite curves).<P>
The solid instance entity allows a copy of another solid to be 
used without redefining it and includes the capability to apply a 
different transformation matrix to the copy.  The boolean tree entity 
describes the operations and operands to build an object which may 
be the entire model under consideration or just a small part.  The 
operators allowed in the boolean tree are intersection, union, and 
subtraction.  The operands may be any CSG solid, solid instances, 
or other boolean trees.  The solid assembly entity defines a collection 
of items that share a fixed geometric relationship.  Any solid objects 
may be grouped by this entity.<P>
