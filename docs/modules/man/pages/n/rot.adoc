= ROT(nged)

== NAME

rot - Rotates the view or an object by xyz degrees.

== SYNOPSIS

*rot* {_x y z_}

== DESCRIPTION

Rotates the view or an object by _xyz_ degrees. Exactly what and how
it is rotated are dependent on MGED's state as well as the state of
the display manager. See [cmd]*arot* for a similar capability.

== EXAMPLES

The two examples show the use of the [cmd]*rot* command to rotate the
view or object by a specified number of degrees about the _x, y,_ or
_z_ axis.

.Rotate the view or object a specified number of degrees about the _z_ axis.
====
[prompt]#mged># [ui]`rot 0 0 45`

Rotates the view or object 45° about the _z_ axis.
====

.Rotate the view or object a specified number of degrees about the _y_ and _x_ axes.
====
[prompt]#mged># [ui]`rot 45 45 0`

Rotates the view or object 45° about the _y_ axis, then rotates 45°
about the _x_ axis.
