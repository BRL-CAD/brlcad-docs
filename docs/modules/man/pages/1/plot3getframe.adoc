== NAME

plot3getframe - extract one frame from a UNIX plot file

== SYNOPSIS

*[cmd]#plot3getframe#* [-v][rep]_desired_frame_<[rep]_unix_plot_

== DESCRIPTION

*[cmd]#plot3getframe#* extracts a single frame from a multi-frame UNIX plot file. Frames are separated by UNIX plot "erase" commands. Specifying the *[opt]#-v#* (verbose) flag causes the number of each frame being skipped to be printed on stderr.

Note that BRL 3-D UNIX plot is a superset of the standard UNIX plot format, thus this program can process normal plot files as well.
