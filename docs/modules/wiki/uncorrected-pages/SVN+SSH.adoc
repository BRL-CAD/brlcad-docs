This page describes how to get set up with an svn+ssh protocol
Subversion checkout from a Sourceforge repository so that you don't have
to specify a password. The svn+ssh method is also more robust and
usually faster than the https method as well.

*1) Generate a password-less ssh keypair.* With OpenSSH it's really
easy, keep hitting Enter to leave the password blank. Obviously, you
need to replace SFUSERNAME with your actual Sourceforge username:

`$ ssh-keygen -C "svn+ssh://SFUSERNAME@svn.code.sf.net/p/brlcad" -f sf_brlcad`

*2) Install the keypair.* Copy the files to ~/.ssh on each system you
use:

`mv sf_brlcad* ~/.ssh/.`

*3) Edit your SSH configuration.* Specify using that key with
Sourceforge. Edit ~/.ssh/config to contain this:

`Host svn.code.sf.net`
`Host svn.code.sourceforge.net`
`Hostname svn.code.sourceforge.net`
`IdentitiesOnly yes`
`IdentityFile ~/.ssh/sf_brlcad`

*4) Publish the public key.* Upload the contents of _sf_brlcad.pub_
to your Sourceforge account:

. Login to the sourceforge.net website.
. Select "Account" from the "Me" menu.
. Paste the contents of your public key file under the "SSH Settings"
tab.

*5) Wait 10 minutes.* It takes time for Sourceforge to update its list
of authorized keys across all their servers.

Once your keys are updated, you should be able to svn checkout
svn+ssh:... and svn up without using a password.
