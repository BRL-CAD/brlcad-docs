= Compiling BRL-CAD with Xcode on Mac OS X

NOTE: Some users have been experiencing problems running through this
process on Mac OS X Mountain Lion, which dropped support for X11. The
problems have been noted and are being worked on.

An already built and running version of BRL-CAD for Mac OS X can be
downloaded from
http://sourceforge.net/projects/brlcad/files/BRL-CAD%20for%20Mac%20OS%20X/[here],
or these steps will guide you through the process of how to compiling
it yourself.

== Obtain Dev Tools

Download the latest version of
http://www.cmake.org/cmake/resources/software.html[CMake for Mac OS
X]. Once downloaded, follow the instructions to install CMake and be
sure to select the box for installing the CMake Command Line tools:

The latest version of the BRL-CAD source is also required, which can
be obtained
https://sourceforge.net/projects/brlcad/files/BRL-CAD%20Source/[here].

You will also need Xcode, which can be downloaded from the Mac App
Store. When installing, make sure you install the unix development
command-line tools. Or if Xcode is already installed on your system,
you can install the command line tools (or double-check to make sure
you have them) by navigating to Xcode Preferences > Downloads and in
the components tab, you should see Command Line Tools:

== Compiling

Navigate to the BRL-CAD source directory you downloaded and create a
new folder titled "brlcad-build." This is where we will store the
configured build:

Open Terminal (in /User/Applications/Utilities) and cd to the location
of the BRL-CAD source folder (Note: you can type cd, press the
spacebar, and then drag the brlcad folder to copy its search path):

[source,bash]
....
cd brlcad-7.22.0
....

Now, we create a BRL-CAD Xcode project that we can use to compile
BRL-CAD: (this may take some time)

[source,bash]
....
cd brlcad-build
cmake .. -G Xcode
....

== Finishing

Open the resulting BRLCAD.xcodeproj file with Xcode and press Build
and Run. Thats it!
