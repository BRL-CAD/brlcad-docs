BRL-CAD build system uses CMake and so I will show you how to build a
project from cross-platform CMake on Eclipse. The CMake 2.8 project
generator for Eclipse does not work, so you must create the project and
configure it to build with GNU Make. Here's how to do it on Linux.

== Create an Eclipse Project

Create an Eclipse CDT (C/C{pp} Development Tooling) project using the
_File > New > C{pp}_ Project command for your C{pp} project, or _File
> New > C_ Project for a C project. Do not create the project
using the CMake Eclipse project generator.

== Create Eclipse Make Targets

The conventional approach to using CMake with Eclipse is to create an
_external tool_ in Eclipse. However, a _Make Target_ is simpler, and
because it is stored in the Eclipse *.project* file, you can check it
into your version control system and it will work in every one of your
working copies, on every computer. Create a Make Target for each
configuration that you want to build. Here I assume that you have the
usual _Release_ and _Debug_ configurations:

* Display the _Make Target_ window using the _Window > Show
View > Make Target_ menu command. It should appear on the right,
with the _Outline_ window.
* Select the folder for the project for which you want to add CMake.
CMake will run with this folder as its working directory.
* Right click on the folder and select _New_ from the context menu.
The _Create Make Target_ dialog will appear.
 ** Type _Target name_ *CMake Release*
 ** In _Make target_, deselect Same _as the target name_, and make
sure that the _Make target_ field is empty
 ** In _Build Command_, deselect _Use builder settings_ and set the
_Build command_ to
  *** `cmake -E chdir Release/ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Release`
 ** Click OK

* Repeat, this time for _Target name_ *CMake Debug*, and _Build
command_:
 ** `cmake -E chdir Debug/ cmake -G "Unix Makefiles" ../ -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE:STRING=Debug`
* Create the *Release/* and *Debug/* directories
 ** `mkdir Release Debug`

== Set Up the Eclipse CDT Builder

Next, set up the CDT builder to run the Makefiles that CMake builds.

* Right click on a CDT project. In the context menu, select
_Properties_.
* On the left, select C/C{pp} _Build_
 ** Set _Configuration_ to _Release_
  *** Choose the _Builder Settings_ tab
   **** Deselect _Use default build command_
   **** Specify the _Build command_:
    ***** `+make -C ${ConfigName}+`
   **** Deselect _Generate Makefiles automatically_
   **** Make the _Build directory_ field blank
   **** The form should appear as shown below:
    ***** image::Compiling-Eclipse-Manually-3.png[Image:Compiling-Eclipse-Manually-3.png]
  *** Choose the _Behavior_ tab
   **** Select _Build (Incremental build)_ and specify the
target name _all_
   **** Select _Clean_ and specify the target name _clean_
   **** The form should appear as shown below:
    ***** image::Compiling-Eclipse-Manually-4.png[Image:Compiling-Eclipse-Manually-4.png]
 ** Set _Configuration_ to _Debug_
  *** Choose the _Builder Settings_ tab
   **** Set all values exactly the same as the _Release_
configuration
  *** Choose the _Behavior_ tab
   **** Set all values exactly the same as the _Release_
configuration
    ***** image::Compiling-Eclipse-Manually-5.png[Image:Compiling-Eclipse-Manually-5.png]
    ***** image::Compiling-Eclipse-Manually-6.png[Image:Compiling-Eclipse-Manually-6.png]
   **** Click OK

== Build the Project

Use CMake to generate an out-of-source GNU Make build system:

* In the _Make Targets_ window, double click on _CMake Release_ or
_CMake Debug_ to generate the GNU Make build system in *Release/*
or *Debug/*, respectively

* If necessary, edit your *CMakeLists.txt* control files
* Delete the contents of the corresponding build directory. For
example:
* `rm -r Release/*`
* and repeat.

Actually, for minor edits to your *CMakeLists.txt* control files, you
need not delete the build directory. However, I cannot tell you exactly
what the threshold for "`minor edits`" is.

Now, build the project the usual way with Eclipse:

* Select the configuration to build (_Release of Debug_) with the
_Project > Build Configurations > Set Active_ command
* Build with the _Project > Build Project_ command
* Edit your source code files, and repeat
