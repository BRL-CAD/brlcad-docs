== NAME

prcolor - Lists the entries in the ident-based color table.
   

== SYNOPSIS

*prcolor* [] []

== DESCRIPTION

Lists the entries in the ident-based color table. The ident number for a displayed region is used to find the appropriate color from the lookup table. The _low_ and _high_ values are the limits of region 	ident numbers to have the indicated _r g b_ color (0-255) applied. The color 	table entries may be modified using the [cmd]*color* command, and the entire color table 	may be edited using the [cmd]*edcolor* command. If a color lookup table exists, its 	entries will override any color assigned using the [cmd]*mater* command.
