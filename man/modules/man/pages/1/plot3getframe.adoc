= PLOT3GETFRAME(1)

== NAME

plot3getframe - extract one frame from a UNIX plot file

== SYNOPSIS

*plot3getframe* [-v] _desired_frame_ < _unix_plot_

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*plot3getframe* extracts a single frame from a multi-frame UNIX
plot file. Frames are separated by UNIX plot "erase" commands.
Specifying the [opt]*-v* (verbose) flag causes the number of each
frame being skipped to be printed on stderr.

Note that BRL 3-D UNIX plot is a superset of the standard UNIX plot
format, thus this program can process normal plot files as well.
