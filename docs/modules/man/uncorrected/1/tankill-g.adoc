== NAME

tankill-g - TANKILL Translator (TANKILL to BRL-CAD)

== SYNOPSIS

*tankill-g*[-n][-t _tolerance_][-i _input_tankill_file_][-o _database.g_]

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*tankill-g* converts the specified __input_tankill_file__ to a BRL-CAD __database.g__ file. The __tolerance__ provided is the maximum distance (in mm) between two vertices at which they will be considered to be the same vertex. The [opt]*-n* option provides output in the form of NMG primitives rather than the default which is BOT objects. The __input_tankill_file__ is expected to be in the __TANKILL__ format used by the British Defense Research Agency. This is a simple triangular patch format where each object is described by a series of vertices. Triangular facets are built from the first, second, and third vertices; from the second, third, and fourth vertices; from the third, fourth and fifth; and so on. Each object is converted to a single BOT object which is then placed into its own region and assigned the component code provided in the TANKILL file.
