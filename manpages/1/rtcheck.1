.SH "NAME"
rtcheck \- Make UNIX\-Plot of overlaps in an mged model, using raytracing
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBrtcheck\fP [\fIoptions\fP]... \fImodel.g\fP \fIobjects\fP... > \fIoverlaps.plot3\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBrtcheck\fP operates on the indicated \fIobjects\fP in the input
\fImodel.g\fP and produces a floating point 3\-D BRL\-style
\fBplot3\fP(5) format file on standard output, in
millimeters.
.sp
The orientation of the rays to be fired may be specified by the
\fB\-a\fP and \fB\-e\fP options, in which case the model will be
autosized, and the grid will be centered on the centroid of the model,
with ray spacing chosen to span the entire set of \fIobjects.\fP
Alternatively, with the \fB\-M\fP option, a transformation matrix may
be provided on standard input which maps model\-space to view\-space. In
this case, the grid ranges from \-1.0 < = X,Y < = +1.0 in view space,
with the size of the grid (number of rays fired) specified with the
\fB\-s\fP option. The \fB\-M\fP option is most useful when
\fBrtcheck\fP is being automatically invoked from within
\fBmged\fP(1) using the \fBrtcheck\fP command in
\fImged\fP.
.sp
The following options are recognized.
.sp
\fB\-g#\fP
.RS 4
The grid cell width, in millimeters.  Ordinarily, the cell
width is computed by dividing the view size by the number of pixels of
width. This option provides an alternate direct means to set the grid
cell width.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-s#\fP
.RS 4
Number of rays to fire in X and Y directions (square
grid). Default is 512 (512 x 512).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-r\fP
.RS 4
Report unique overlaps. At the end of a view, a list of unique
pairs of overlapping regions is printed, along with a count of the
number of detected overlaps for each pair. Not all detected overlap
combinations are necessarily listed, as the overlap partition may mask
a second overlap that is a continuation of an already detected
overlap.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-a#\fP
.RS 4
Select azimuth in degrees.  Used with \fB\-e\fP and conflicts
with \fB\-M\fP
.RE
.sp
\fB\-e#\fP
.RS 4
Select elevation in degrees.  Used with \fB\-a\fP and
conflicts with \fB\-M\fP
.RE
.sp
\fB\-G\fP
.RS 4
Sets the grid cell height, in millimeters.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-M\fP
.RS 4
Read model2view matrix from standard input. Conflicts with
\fB\-a\fP and \fB\-e\fP
.RE
.sp
\fB\-P#\fP
.RS 4
Specify the maximum number of processors (in a multi\-processor
system) to be used for this execution.  The default is 1.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-+ t\fP
.RS 4
Specify that rtcheck should output plot file data in text
format. Default is binary plot data.
.RE
.sp
\fBrtcheck\fP also accepts all other options that the
\fBrt\fP(1) program implements, such as for non\-square
views, perspective, etc.
.sp
The \fBrtcheck\fP program is a simple front\-end to
\fBlibrt\fP(3) which is most useful when used from
\fBmged\fP(1). The output can be independently
viewed using the UNIX\-plot viewers like
\fBplot3\-fb\fP(1),
\fBtplot\fP(1), etc.

Numerous error conditions are possible. Descriptive messages are
printed on stderr (file descriptor 2).
