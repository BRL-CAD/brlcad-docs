<TITLE>IGES 4.0 to BRL-CAD Translator for CSG Models</TITLE>
<H2>CURRENT STATUS</H2>

An IGES to BRL-CAD translator (post-processor) has been developed 
based on the ANSI standard ASME Y14.26M-1989, which is essentially 
IGES 4.0.  Therefore, this translator accommodates (with approximations 
in some cases) all the ANSI (i.e., IGES) CSG entities.  The translator 
does not support the IGES BREP entities from IGES Version 5.1  The 
current translator reads the IGES file, checks for correct syntax, 
then proceeds to construct the <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> model.  The translator makes 
extensive use of the <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> <I>libwdb</I> package, thus avoiding 
concerns about the details of the <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> database format as well 
as future concerns about changes to that format.  The following routines 
from <I>libwdb</I> are used:
<UL>
<LI><I>mk_id</I> creates an ident record for the entire database
<LI><I>mk_rcc</I> creates a right-circular cylinder
<LI><I>mk_trc</I> creates a truncated right-circular cone
<LI><I>mk_tgc</I> creates a truncated general cone
<LI><I>mk_arb8</I> creates a polyhedron of eight vertices
<LI><I>mk_sph</I> creates a sphere
<LI><I>mk_ell</I> creates a general ellipsoid
<LI><I>mk_tor</I> creates a torus
<LI><I>mk_addmember</I> adds a name to a list of members for future inclusion in a group
<LI><I>mk_lcomb</I> creates a combination, region, or group
</UL>
When transformation matrices and translations are present 
in an IGES file, they follow the same convention as <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> does and 
can be used as arguments in the <I>mk_addmember</I> calls 
for building combinations.  Any transformations applied to top level 
objects are applied by creating a new top level group named <EM>all</EM> 
that contains all unreferenced objects with their transformations 
applied.<P>

The IGES to BRL-CAD post-processor described above has been implemented 
and has been successfully exercised on a number of actual IGES CSG 
files.  Some of these files were obtained from CAD systems that support 
IGES and some were hand developed for the purpose of testing this 
software.  The four following illustrations show solid models that were originally 
generated on a Calma CAD system and translated to <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> via IGES. <A HREF="ref.html#SDRC[8]"><STRONG>SDRC[8]</STRONG></A>
The models were converted to <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> using the IGES to BRL-CAD 
translator and then rendered by <EM>BRL-CAD</EM>'s ray-tracer <I>rt</I>.<P>

These models contained some of the IGES entities that are not 
supported by <EM>BRL-CAD</EM>.  However, the resulting models are certainly 
acceptable for most applications.  The necked-down cylinder portion 
of the part in the first illustration is a solid of revolution (and approximated 
by a combination of <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> <I>gentgc</I> primitives as described 
above).  The three <I>ears</I> on the same part are solids of linear 
extrusion (and are <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> polysolid approximations).  
The next two are views of a model that was used as the AUTOFACT 
V demonstration part.  AUTOFACT is a national convention focusing 
on manufacturing technology and the transfer of part designs from 
system to system.  The model in the fourth illustration contains three solids of 
linear extrusions and five solids of revolution.  In spite of our 
translator's approximations, we think the reader will agree that the 
resulting <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> model looks like a reasonable object (whatever it 
is).<P>
The following four figures illustrate original <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> models that 
have been converted to the IGES format and then translated back to 
<EM>BRL-CAD</EM> via the current IGES translator.<P>

The translation to IGES was 
performed by a rudimentary translator with some manual file editing.  
For practical purposes, the tin
woodsman model shown in the first pair of figures translated to and from IGES without 
loss of precision or geometry.  Some nongeometry information was lost 
in the process, such as object names and material properties.  In 
the third figure, a building rests on a mirrored surface, but that same building 
after translation to IGES and back rests on a geometrically equivalent 
surface that does not possess the mirror property.  Also, the colors for
this object have not been converted to IGES because the colors in the original
model were not assigned to the objects, but were listed in a color table
that associates ranges of object ident numbers with colors.  Object colors 
are translated by using a field in the object directory entry.  This 
color field may contain either a color index referring to a predefined 
set of colors or a pointer to a color definition entity.  The color 
definition entity allows colors to be specified by a three-tuple indicating 
red, green, and blue intensities similar to that used in <EM>BRL-CAD</EM>, so 
the object color gets translated exactly.  The current translator 
does not handle material properties, object names, or color tables although there 
are IGES entities available to support all these items.<P>

IGES 4.0 also includes the capability to exchange a variety of 
three-dimensional surfaces.  The <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> translator takes advantage 
of this capability in a limited way by converting Non-Uniform Rational 
B-spline surfaces (NURBS) to a <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> <I>spline</I> solid.  Since there is 
no topology present for BREP models in IGES 4.0, there is no way to 
infer how to combine the NURBS to produce solids.  This translator 
makes the assumption that all the NURBS in the IGES file are part 
of a single solid.  This may not always be a correct assumption, but 
it at least provides a minimal translation capability for CAD systems 
that produce NURBS and NURB-surfaced solids.  This feature is not 
intended to be a true BREP translator and will likely be replaced 
in future releases with a more rigorous approach.<P>
