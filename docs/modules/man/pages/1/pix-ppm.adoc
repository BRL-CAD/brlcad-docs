= PIX-PPM(1)

== NAME

pix-ppm - convert a BRL-CAD PIX or BW format image to a PPM format
image

== SYNOPSIS

*pix-ppm* [-a] [-s _squaresize_] [-w _file_width_] [-n _file_height_] [-# _bytes_per_pixel_] [-o _PPM_file_] [_PIX_file_] > _PPM_file_

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*pix-ppm* converts a _BRL PIX(5)_ format file to a _PPM_
(Portable PixMap) format file on the standard output. The PPM file
created will be either an RGB file with 3 bytes per pixel (default) or
a B&W file with 1 byte per pixel.

PIX image files do not contain information about their size.  The size
of the input PIX image file must be specified if the dimensions are
not the default 512x512 size.

== OPTIONS

*-a*:: autosize the input file to determine file image height and
width

*-s squaresize*:: sets both the width and the height for the input to
be _squaresize_

*-w file_width*:: tells [cmd]*pix-ppm* that the input is _file_width_
pixels wide

*-n file_height*:: tells [cmd]*pix-ppm* that the input is
_file_height_ scanlines tall

*-# bytes_per_pixel*:: tells [cmd]*pix-ppm* how many bytes there are
per pixel in the input PIX or BW file

*-o PPM_file*:: tells [cmd]*pix-ppm* to write image data to the
specified _PPM_file_ output file.  The [cmd]*pix-ppm* command will not
write out binary image data directly to a terminal device as a
safeguard.
