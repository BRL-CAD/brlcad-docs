== NAME

fbgrid - draw a grid on a frame buffer

== SYNOPSIS

*fbgrid* [-cbdo] [-F _framebuffer_] [-S _squaresize_] [-W _width_] [-N _height_]

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*fbgrid* is used to generate a grid on a frame buffer. The environment variable [var]`FB_FILE` is used to select the display device (see xref:man:1/brlcad.adoc[*brlcad*(1)]). If this variable is not set, the default device for your system will be used. The [opt]*-SWN* options can all be used in the normal way to specify the size of the grid (see xref:man:1/brlcad.adoc[*brlcad*(1)]). The default grid size is 512x512. The framebuffer can be declared with the [opt]*-F* flag. [opt]*-c* will clear the screen before drawing.

The available patterns are: [opt]*-b* for binary spacing with lines at 8, 64, and 128 line intervals. [opt]*-d* for decimal spacing with lines at 10, 50, and 100 line intervals (the default). [opt]*-o* for the old cross grid pattern.
