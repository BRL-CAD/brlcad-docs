      Calculates an approximate presented area of one region in the
      mged display.
    

== SYNOPSIS

*area* [_tolerance_]

== DESCRIPTION

Calculates an approximate presented area of one region in the ____mged display. For this command to work properly, a single BRL-CAD region must be displayed using the [cmd]*E* command. The _tolerance_ is the distance required between two vertices in order for them to be recognized as distinct vertices. This calculation considers only the minimum bounding polygon of the region and ignores holes.
