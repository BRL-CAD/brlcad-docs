<H2>SOLID MODELS</H2>

Generally, there are three accepted types of solid modeling techniques
<UL>
<LI>Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG)
<LI>Boundary Representation (BREP)
<LI>Hybrids
</UL>


The CSG system uses a variety of (generally simple) primitive solid 
shapes, such as cones, cylinders, spheres, ellipsoids, boxes, and 
so forth, as the basis for the construction of more complex objects 
by employing combining operators such as union, intersection, and 
subtraction.  Often the combining operators are called booleans.
Sometimes the familiar combining operations are hidden from 
the user, but they are still there nevertheless.  For example, in 
a feature-based CSG system, the user can <EM>drill</EM> a hole through 
an object by specifying a hole command, rather than 
by explicitly defining the <EM>hole</EM> as a subtraction of the appropriate 
cylinder from the object.  However, the subtraction operator and the 
operands are stored by the CSG system (as a form of boolean tree
) to define the new object.<P>

The BREP systems create solid objects by defining a surface (or 
a collection of surfaces) that completely encloses the volume of the 
object.  The shape of the surface(s) defines the shape of the object.  
These surface definitions often include a variety of forms such as 
B-splines, Bezier patches, Coons patches, simple planes, or merely 
faceted (tesselated) surfaces.<P>

Hybrid systems are a combination of both CSG and BREP.  The user, 
typically, can choose from a palette of simple shapes and then use 
combining operations to produce a model; or the user may select from 
a variety of surfaces and trim, cut, or otherwise manipulate them 
to define the model.  However, nearly all hybrid systems evaluate 
their CSG constructs to produce a final BREP form of the model.  The 
current release of the Army Research Laboratory's (ARL) Computer-Aided 
Design package (BRL-CAD 4.0) is a hybrid system, although its CSG capabilities 
are most visible and available to the user in the interactive editor 
mged, and <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> does not generally produce the final model 
as a BREP.  The spline-surfaced solid, the ARS solid, 
the polysolid, and the new NMG solid 
are all examples of BREP-type objects.<P>

As designers became more dependent on CAD systems, there was 
a logical progression into solid modeling because of its useful potential.  
Remember, human beings invented engineering drawings to capture and 
communicate design intent among humans.  But now humans 
are coming to realize that machines can recognize design intent more 
easily in forms other than three-view engineering drawings.  Today's 
emphasis is on machine-to-machine communication, often linking the 
design of a part (on one machine) to ultimately the computer-driven 
machine tool (on another machine).  Thus, the solid model is emerging 
as the specification of the part (the product definition).  
Accordingly, many CAD vendors include solid modeling capabilities 
in their systems and some are including additional applications capabilities 
such as finite element analysis based on the solid model.  (The term 
computer-aided engineering (CAE) is evolving as the descriptor 
used to distinguish the workstation with these new capabilities from 
the traditional CAD faculty.)  As the engineers in the 1970s realized 
that some method was needed for exchanging CAD-generated engineering 
drawings between CAD systems, now they realize that the same need 
exists for CAD-generated solid models.<P>
