== NAME

fb-bw - save a framebuffer image in a black and white bw file

== SYNOPSIS

*fb-bw* [-i] [-F _framebuffer_] [-X _scr_xoff_] [-Y _scr_yoff_] [-s _squaresize_] [-w _width_] [-n _height_] [_file.bw_]

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*fb-bw* will take a region of a framebuffer display and save it
as a black and white xref:man:5/bw.adoc[*bw*(5)] format file. The
environment variable [var]`FB_FILE` is used to select the display
device (see xref:man:1/brlcad.adoc[*brlcad*(1)]). If this variable is
not set, the default device for your system will be
used. Alternatively, the framebuffer may be explicitly specified by
using the [opt]*-F* flag.

By default, the output file will be size 512x512 pixels. The [opt]*-s*
flag will set both the file height and width to be the given size,
while [opt]*-w* and [opt]*-n* are used for setting them individually.

A first quadrant coordinate system is used (origin in lower left of
screen), and the area saved is normally from this origin.  The
[opt]*-X* and [opt]*-Y* flags can be used to move the origin to an
offset position on the screen. The [opt]*-i* flag switches to a fourth
quadrant system, both in the storage order as well as the origin
offset coordinates (i.e. origin is now the upper left corner of the
screen).

An equal blending of red, green, and blue is done.  For more
complicated black and white conversion use
xref:man:1/fb-pix.adoc[*fb-pix*(1)] and
xref:man:1/pix-bw.adoc[*pix-bw*(1)].
