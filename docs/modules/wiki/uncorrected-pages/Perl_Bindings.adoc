This project proposal is to use SWIG to wrap BRL-CAD libraries with Perl
bindings.

The goal of this GSOC task is to wrap the BRL-CAD ray-tracing library
(and its dependencies) for use by Perl.

A requirement of the task will be to include the SWIG wrapping as an
option in the overall BRL-CAD build structure.

A desirable feature will be to generalize the structure as much as
possible to ease adding other language bindings (as well as BRL-CAD
libraries) via SWIG.
