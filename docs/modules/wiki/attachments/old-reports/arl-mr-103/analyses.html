Analyses and Geometry Requirements</a></h1>
<p>
       In the following sections we will examine the major types of
       analyses which utilize BRL-CAD geometry, presenting a brief
       synopsis of the capabilities, limitations, and requirements
       of each.  Then we will discuss how these characteristics
       translate into demands on the geometric target description
       required to support each level of analysis.  The selection
       of analysis codes considered is not intended to be all
       inclusive, rather an examination of the major types of
       analyses most often encountered.  The analysis codes will be
       considered in somewhat of a chronological order of
       development.
<p>
<h2><A NAME="Nuclear Assessment">Nuclear Assessment</a></h2>
<p>
       The Vehicle Code System <a HREF="refer.html#VCS[4]"><b>(VCS)[4]</b></a> is the nuclear
       vulnerability assessment code and is used to evaluate the
       shielding properties of a vehicle against initial nuclear
       radiation.  The VCS code uses a Monte Carlo module,
       Multigroup Oak Ridge Stochastic Experiment <a HREF="refer.html#MORSE[5]#"><b>(MORSE)[5]</b></a>
       code, to estimate radiation transport through the vehicle.  The
       VCS code calculates estimates of the radiation dosage
       received by individual crew members, the only critical
       components of the target.
<p>
       Target descriptions prepared for the VCS code have
       traditionally been the most limited and specialized.  The
       VCS target description requirements<a href="refer.html#SCHMOKE[6]"><b>[6]</b></a> were first presented
       in detail in 1976.  As significant advances have been made
       in computing power and memory, many of these restrictions no
       longer exist, but will be presented for completeness.  The
       most restrictive condition was the limitation on the number
       of primitives allowed.  In the late 1970s, nuclear target
       descriptions were limited to 600 primitives, preferably less
       than 300.  This size restriction had several implications,
       the obvious being the amount of detail, which had to be used
       judiciously.  Components with like attenuation
       characteristics had to be combined, while other components
       such as the hull, turret, suspension, and main armament had
       to be modeled in low detail.  Larger components which would
       offer significant shielding, such as stowed ammo, also had
       to represented, but as an aggregate volume.
<p>
       The size restrictions of the VCS code no longer exist;
       however, there are some requirements that still must be
       considered when preparing a VCS target description.  An
       accurate description of the armor shell is required.  Armor
       thickness is important, but unlike ballistic models, the
       obliquity angles are less critical.  Still, since the target
       description may be used for other purposes, accurate
       obliquity angles should be modeled.  The exterior shell
       should include areas where radiation particles may gain
       entrance.  This means that detail and clearances are
       important in areas such as hatches, sighting devices, and
       air intake and exhaust grills and vents.  All critical
       components that could be affected by radiation, including
       the crew, should be included.  Likewise, all major internal
       components that provide shielding, must be represented.  All
       internal air must be modeled as a regular component.
       Finally, the complete target must be enclosed in an external
       air region, sitting on a region representing the ground.
<p>
<h2><a name="Compartment Level">Compartment Level</a></h2>
<p>
       The compartment-level vulnerability methodology was the
       first approach to V/L assessment and, as mentioned earlier,
       was the driving force behind the development of geometric
       modeling and ray-tracing.  There were two early
       compartment-level V/L codes, one for kinetic energy warheads
       and one for chemical energy (shaped charge) warheads.  In
       1979, these codes were combined into the <a href="refer.html#VAMP[7]"><b>VAMP[7]</b></a> code.  The
       compartment-level codes are the least sophisticated of the
       V/L codes.  True to their name, these codes consider the
       target as a series of compartments contained within an
       armored shell.  Penetration calculations are matched against
       the armor defeat criteria.  Upon perforation, the residual
       energy (represented by a hole size) is used to predict
       damage from a compartment kill curve.  The only internal
       components that are considered on an individual basis are
       those that would contribute to a catastrophic kill (K-kill)
       of the vehicle.
<p>
       There are several important considerations when preparing a
       compartment-level target description.  The armor shell must
       be described as accurately as possible since the thickness
       and obliquity angle are crucial in penetration calculations.
       Other exterior components that would affect penetration,
       such as the main gun, suspension components, and roadwheels,
       must be represented.  <p>

<p>
       The complete interior volume within the armor shell must be
       modeled and divided into compartments.  The compartments of
       interest are the crew, engine, and ammo.  Defining these
       compartments is accomplished by modeling air regions and
       assigning differentiating "air codes".  There must not be
       any space between the inner surface of the armor and the air
       regions (compartments).  There is interior space that must
       not be included as part of the crew, engine, or ammo
       compartments.  These areas, such as between the hull belly
       and the floor and between the armor wall and an adjacent
       fuel tank, are modeled and identified as separate
       compartments.<p>

</pre>
       Figure (6) shows these "compartment air
       regions" along with the enclosing armor shell.  Any K-kill
       component, such as fuel tanks and stowed ammo, must also be
       represented.  In addition, large shielding components, such
       as engines and transmissions, are usually modeled at a low
       level of detail.  Other interior components need not be
       modeled.

<h2><a name="Component Level - Parallel Ray">Component Level - Parallel Ray</a></h2>
<p>
       The component-level vulnerability codes represent the next
       level of complexity in that the target is analyzed at the
       individual component level.  The first such code was known
       as the <a href="refer.html#VAREA[8]"><b>VAREA[8]</b></a> code and was used for lightly armored
       vehicles, trucks, etc.  The 
	<a href="refer.html#COVART[9]"><b>COVART[9]</b></a> family of codes
       performs similar tasks for aircraft.  These codes compute
       the vulnerability estimates in terms of vulnerable areas for
       specific penetrators, usually fragments and small caliber
       direct fire weapons.  This methodology requires component
       conditional kill probabilities given a hit for every
       critical component.  The vulnerable area of the target from
       a specific view is the sum of all the individual grid-cell
       vulnerable areas.  The grid-cell vulnerable areas are
       determined by calculating a cell probability of kill and
       multiplying it by the area of the cell.  The view vulnerable
       area data are presented in a table for the various fragment
       mass and velocity combinations.
<p>
       It is no surprise that the geometry requirements for the
       VAREA codes shifted emphasis to the individual component.
       The exterior shell must continue to be modeled as accurately
       as possible.  Other exterior components must include any
       critical components plus any component that could contribute
       to a K-kill.  Any exterior component should also be included
       if it provides any significant shielding or affects the
       penetration capability of the warhead.

<h3> Figure 8. Exterior of a Component-Level Description.</h3></a>
</pre>
       Figure 8 shows the
       detail of the exterior of a component-level target
       description.  All critical internal components must be
       modeled in enough detail to support a component kill
       analysis.  The component conditional kill analysis uses
       presented areas of the component from several aspects,
       ratioing projected areas of sensitive regions with the total
       presented area.  Thus, the presented area of the model of
       the component should accurately represent the real
       component.  Any other noncritical internal component that
       provides effective ballistic shielding should also be
       included.  At this level, components such as wiring
       harnesses and fuel and hydraulic lines are generally
       modeled.

<h2><a name="Component Level - Point Burst">Component Level - Point Burst</a></h2>
<p>
       The point burst assessment codes are simply an extension of
       the VAREA level codes, except the damage resulting from
       behind-armor debris (or spall) is explicitly estimated.
       Parallel shotlines are used to simulate the main penetrator
       while divergent shotlines (or spall rays) simulate the spall
       debris.  The spall rays are initiated whenever a burst point
       is encountered along the path of a main penetrator.  A burst
       point is defined whenever a main penetrator exits an armor
       component directly into an interior volume.  The first point
       burst V/L code was the <a href="refer.html#VAST[10]"><b>VAST[10]</b></a> code, which evaluated
       kinetic energy and shaped charge warheads versus tanks.  In
       1988, a stochastic point burst V/L code called 
<a href="refer.html#SQuASH[11]"><b>SQuASH[11]</b></a>
       was introduced and represents a significant improvement in
       armored vehicle vulnerability modeling.
<p>
       The geometry requirements necessary to support a point burst
       V/L analysis are nearly identical to the VAREA requirements
       as far as the components are concerned.  The one major
       difference is the need to identify burst points.  Recall,
       burst points are located on the inner surface of armor
       components that are adjacent to interior volume.  Hence, to
       locate the burst points it is necessary to know when one has
       entered the interior.  As in the compartment analyses, this
       is accomplished by representing all interior volume as air
       regions and then identifying those where spall rays should
       be initiated.  Note that one should avoid any "undefined"
       volume between the exterior shell and the air regions, or
       the burst points could be missed.  Figures 10 through 13 are
       used to compare the detail of several subsystems of
       compartment-level and component-level target descriptions.<p>

<h2><a name="SPARC">SPARC</a></h2>
<p>
       For many years, spare parts for military systems were
       stocked according to life expectancies and mean-time-
       between-failures in a peacetime environment.  Little
       consideration was given to parts likely to be damaged in
       battle.  In the early 1980s, the SPARC (Sustainability
       Predictions for Army spare component Requirements for
       Combat) program was started to address this oversight.  The
       <a href="refer.html#SPARC[12]"><b>SPARC[12]</b></a> code was developed to quantify spare parts
       requirements in support of combat damage repair.  The SPARC
       methodology is really an adaptation of the point burst
       methodology and, therefore, accounts for damage from both
       the main penetrator and spall debris.  The major difference
       was the introduction of the concept of the mission-essential
       component, a more inclusive classification than the standard
       V/L critical component.  Any component whose loss would
       require repair or replacement either to prevent damage to
       other components or to maintain long-term operational
       readiness and reliability is considered mission essential.
<p>
       SPARC target description requirements are basically the same
       as the point burst V/L analysis, except for the concept of
       mission-essential components.  All components that would be
       considered critical in a point burst analysis are also
       considered mission essential.  However, noncritical
       components may become mission essential if they must be
       replaced when damaged to maintain long-term operational
       status.  For example, consider the third roadwheel of a
       tracked vehicle.  This roadwheel is not considered V/L
       critical since the vehicle is still functional when the
       roadwheel is damaged.  However, this damaged roadwheel could
       lead to problems with other suspension components such as
       torsion bars and the track and is, therefore, considered a
       mission-essential component for a SPARC analysis.  All
       mission-essential components, even redundant components,
       must be uniquely identified.  It is necessary, therefore, to
       assure that the regions used to model a component are
       uniquely identified, and any other occurrence of that
       component must be distinguished from others.
<p>
<h2><a name="SAR">SAR</a></h2>
<p>
       This methodology predicts Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR)
       images by ray-tracing the geometric model.  At every
       intersection with the geometry, the ray is reflected in
       another direction according to the surface geometry and
       appropriate physical laws.  This process is continued until
       the ray is reflected back to the sensor or leaves the scene.
<p>
       The geometry requirements for a SAR analysis are quite
       different than those discussed up to this point.  If the
       target exterior is completely conducting (i.e., metal), then
       no internal components are required.  However, if portions
       of the exterior shell (or any exterior component) are
       comprised of nonconducting material (e.g., glass, plastic,
       etc.), then appropriate internal components should be
       modeled.  Likewise, hubs and rims should be modeled in
       detail as rubber is also transparent to radar.  Generally
       though, all the detail is concentrated on the exterior
       surface.  Since surface normals and curvature information
       are required, the exterior shell must be as accurate as
       possible.  Curved surfaces must be modeled as such and as
       faithfully as possible.  Thicknesses are unimportant, but if
       known should be modeled accurately.  All exterior
       accessories should be modeled and in great detail.
       Components such as headlights, taillights, hinges, handles,
       braces, supports, large bolt heads, and individual track
       links should be included in the model.  Even rounded corners
       should be considered for larger components such as external
       fuel tanks.  This detail is required since any condition
       that might possibly give a SAR return (e.g., a small corner
       reflector) should be geometrically modeled.  Figures 14 and
       15 are exterior views of a SAR-level target description with
       several areas of detail highlighted.

<h2><a name="IR Modeling">Ir Modeling</a></h2>
<p>
       The InfraRed (IR) methodology is designed to predict surface
       temperatures of targets.  The Physically Reasonable Infrared
       Signature Model <a href="refer.html#PRISM[13]"><b>(PRISM)[13]</b></a> code is one of several such
       codes in use today.  The PRISM code is a lumped parameter
       finite difference model which requires that geometric
       regions be represented as nodes.  Thus, conversion processes
       are required to prepare a CSG model for input to this
       thermal model.  The conversion process uses the geometry to
       create the nodal inputs 
<a href="images/figure_16.gif"><b>(see Figure 16)</b></a>.  Afterwards, the
       geometry is again referenced to display the resulting
       thermal predictions.  The Faceted Region EDitor <a href="refer.html#FRED[14]"><b>(FRED)[14]</b></a>
       and the <a href="refer.html#IRPREP[15]"><b>IRPREP[15]</b></a>
       are two such codes designed to convert
       BRL-CAD geometric models for input to the PRISM code.
<pre>
<a href="images/figure_16.gif"><img src="images/f_small_16.gif">
<h3> Figure 16.</h3></a>
</pre>
       The thermal prediction models do place several unique
       requirements on the target description.  The heat flow
       analysis requires that the CSG regions be isothermal.  This
       means portions of the exterior shell of a vehicle, that
       would be modeled as one region for ballistic V/L analyses,
       may now need to be divided into a number of smaller regions
       to reduce temperature variance over the regions.  PRISM
       requires that any region have only one surface normal.  To
       accommodate this requirement, during the conversion, the
       surface normals are averaged over the region; hence, a large
       region with numerous surface normals should be divided into
       smaller regions.  For example, if the turret of a tank is
       modeled as one large region, there will be only one surface
       normal associated with the whole turret 
<a href="images/figure_16.gif"><b>(see Figure 17)</b></a>. As
       in the compartment and point burst V/L descriptions, the
       internal volume must be modeled as air regions.  The only
       interior components required are those comprising the engine
       and air intake and exhaust ducts.  All these requirements
       are further explained in the IRPREP reference.
