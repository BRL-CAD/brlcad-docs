.SH "NAME"
morphedit \- set up line segment correspondences between pix(5) images
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBmorphedit.tcl\fP [\-w \fIwidth\fP] [\-n \fIheight\fP] \fIpicA.pix\fP \fIpicB.pix\fP \fIlinesfile\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBmorphedit\fP allows the user to set up line segment
correspondences to be used by the utility \fBpixmorph\fP.
.sp
First, the program displays the two images and presents a dialog box
in which the user can enter values for \fIa, b,\fP and \fIp\fP (see
\fIpixmorph(1)\fP for details on these constants). [Note: after replacing
these values, the user must press <Enter> for the new values to be
recorded.]
.sp
The user is now editing the lines file \fIlinesfile\fP. The purpose of
writing a lines file is to set up correspondences between the two
images to improve the quality of morphed images produced by utilities
such as \fBpixmorph\fP . To set up a correspondence, the user must
create a (directed) line segment for each image that specifies which
feature of the first image corresponds to which feature of the second.
These directed line segments are created in the following fashion.
.sp
To create the first endpoint of a new line segment, the user presses
the left mouse button at the desired location in either image.  The
point appears at the same location in the other image.  While the
mouse button is held down, the endpoint may be dragged to any location
(including off of the image... please do not misplace endpoints in
this fashion \(em they are very difficult to recover).  Releasing the
mouse button deposits the endpoint at that location.
.sp
To specify the second endpoint, the user presses the left mouse button
at a location in the image currently unoccupied by endpoints.  The
line segment is drawn between the first and second endpoints; and, as
before, this endpoint may be dragged to any location.
.sp
Endpoints may be created in pairs in this fashion.  Additionally,
endpoints and line segments can be selected (by pressing the left
mouse button while in the vicinity of the point or segment) and moved
(by moving the mouse while the button is held) in either image as
desired.
.sp
To display the orientation of a line segment, the user moves the mouse
cursor until it is over the line segment in question.  The first
endpoints of the segments of both images appear white, and the second
endpoints of the segments of both images appear black.  Specifying the
wrong orientation of a line segment usually results in a poor \(em albeit somewhat psychedelic \(em morphed image, so users are encouraged
to take advantage of this feature to verify that their line segment
correspondences make sense.
.sp
The "Save" button writes the currently displayed line segment
correspondence set, along with the constants \fIa\fP, \fIb\fP, and \fIp\fP, to the
file \fIlinesfile\fP. The "Quit" button closes all associated windows and
terminates the program.
.sp
The "Preview" button, with corresponding \fIfraction\fP entry box, spawns
a process to display the morph specified by the given fraction and the
last \fBsaved\fP version of \fIlinesfile\fP. (Note: this currently uses the
utilities \fBpixmorph\fP and \fBpix\-fb\fP. If the "Preview" button
fails, verify that the paths to these utilities (specified in the
first few lines of \fImorphedit.tcl\fP) are correct.
.sp
Note: \fBmorphedit.tcl\fP uses \fIbwish\fP instead of the standard Tcl/Tk
\fIwish\fP, since \fIbwish\fP supports \fIpix\fP images while \fIwish\fP does not.  If
you have difficulty running \fImorphedit.tcl\fP, make sure the first line
of \fBmorphedit.tcl\fP (giving the path to \fIbwish\fP) is correct.

At this time, line segments cannot be deleted. Unwanted
correspondences should be recycled elsewhere.
