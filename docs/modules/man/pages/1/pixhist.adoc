== NAME

pixhist - display a histogram of a color pix file on a framebuffer

== SYNOPSIS

*[cmd]#pixhist#* [-v][[rep]_file.pix_]

== DESCRIPTION

*[cmd]#pixhist#* displays a histogram of the pixel values of the given xref:man:5/pix.adoc[*pix*](5) format file, or, if no file is specified, will read from standard input. The environment variable [var]*FB_FILE* is used to select the display device (see xref:man:1/brlcad.adoc[*brlcad*](1)). If this variable is not set, the default device for your system will be used.

The relative frequency is displayed on the x axis scaled so that the maximum is full screen.  The value 0 is at the bottom of the screen, 255 is at the top. All three colors will be drawn on each scan line, and all are scaled by the same factor. The output is overlaid on whatever is currently on the display.

The *[opt]#-v#* flag will output the histogram values on the terminal (standard error).
