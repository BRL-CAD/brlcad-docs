.SH "NAME"
pixhist \- display a histogram of a color pix file on a framebuffer
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBpixhist\fP [\-v] [\fIfile.pix\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBpixhist\fP displays a histogram of the pixel values of the given
\fBpix\fP(5) format file, or, if no file is
specified, will read from standard input. The environment variable
\f(CRFB_FILE\fP is used to select the display device (see
\fBbrlcad\fP(1)). If this variable is not set, the
default device for your system will be used.
.sp
The relative frequency is displayed on the x axis scaled so that the
maximum is full screen.  The value 0 is at the bottom of the screen,
255 is at the top. All three colors will be drawn on each scan line,
and all are scaled by the same factor. The output is overlaid on
whatever is currently on the display.
.sp
The \fB\-v\fP flag will output the histogram values on the terminal
(standard error).
