rt \- raytrace an mged model, giving a shaded picture
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBrt\fP [\fIoptions\fP]... \fImodel.g\fP \fIobjects\fP...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBrt\fP operates on the indicated \fIobjects\fP in the input \fImodel.g\fP
and produces a color\-shaded image as the output. By default, the
output is placed on the current framebuffer as it is computed.  The
environment variable FB_FILE specifies the current framebuffer, see
\fBbrlcad\fP(1). Alternatively, the output can be
stored in a pixel file (\fBpix\fP(5) format) by
specifying \fB\-o\fP \fIoutput.pix\fP or in a PNG image file by
specifying \fB\-o\fP \fIoutput.png\fP in the option list. The
orientation of the rays to be fired may be specified by the \fB\-a\fP
and \fB\-e\fP options, in which case the model will be autosized, and
the grid will be centered on the centroid of the model, with ray
spacing chosen to span the entire set of \fIobjects\fP.  Alternatively,
with the \fB\-M\fP option, a transformation matrix may be provided on
standard input which maps model\-space to view\-space. In this case, the
grid ranges from \-1.0 = X,Y = +1.0 in view space, with the size of the
grid (number of rays fired) specified with \fB\-s\fP.  The \fB\-M\fP
option is most useful when \fBrt\fP is being invoked from a shell
script created by an \fBmged\fP(1)\fIsaveview\fP
command.
.sp
The following options are recognized:
.sp
\fB\-. #\fP
.RS 4
selects the factor used in NUgrid algorithm. Default is 1.5 .
.RE
.sp
\fB\-, #\fP
.RS 4
selects which space partitioning algorithm to use
.RE
.sp
\fB\-a #\fP
.RS 4
selects auto\-sizing, and gives the view azimuth in degrees.
Used with \fB\-e\fP and conflicts with \fB\-M\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-b "# #"\fP
.RS 4
is sometimes useful for debugging.  A single ray is
fired at the pixel coordinates specified. This is best when
accompanied by debugging options. Note that the standard
\fBgetopt\fP(3) routine only allows options to
have one parameter, so the X and Y pixel coordinates need to be
combined into one string parameter by enclosing them in double quotes.
This option must follow any viewing parameters.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-c "script_command"\fP
.RS 4
supplies, on the command line, any command
that can appear in a \fB\-M\fP command script. For example, \fB\-c
"set"\fP will print the values of all settable variables.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-e #\fP
.RS 4
selects auto\-sizing, and gives the view elevation in degrees.
Used with \fB\-a\fP and conflicts with \fB\-M\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-g #\fP
.RS 4
sets the grid cell width, in millimeters. Ordinarily, the
cell width is computed by dividing the view size by the number of
pixels of width, so this option need not be used. To obtain exactly 1
inch ray spacing, specify \fB\-g25.4 .\fP If the grid cell width is
specified and the grid cell height (which would be set using
\fB\-G\fP) is \fInot\fP specified, the grid cell height defaults to be the
same as the width.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-m density,r,g,b\fP
.RS 4
enables an exponential shading of the void
between the eye and the first hit location.  This allows a cheap
simulation of atmospheric haze with lower performance impact than
explicit modeling of the air volume. The haze is computed using the
form:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
f = e^(\-distance * density)
g = 1.0 \- f
color = color * f + hazeRGB * g
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
The color values are optional.  If not specified, they will have the
passable values 0.8 .9 .99 .
.sp
Example usage: \-m \(aq2.5e\-8,.75,.95,.99\(aq
.RE
.sp
\fB\-i\fP
.RS 4
enables \fIincremental mode\fP processing. (First, a single ray is
fired. Then, the screen is subdivided into four parts by evenly
subdividing in the vertical and horizontal directions. The previously
fired ray was the lower left corner; three more rays are fired. This
process recurses until full resolution has been reached. Assumes
square image. Also assumes fast path between CPU and display
hardware.)
.RE
.sp
\fB\-j xmin,ymin,xmax,ymax\fP
.RS 4
enables processing of \fIjust a
sub\-rectangle\fP, located within the rectangle (0,0) (width\-1,height\-1),
and whose screen coordinates (lower left and upper right corners) are
provided in the argument. Ray\-tracing will be limited to just those
pixels within the sub\-rectangle, and only those pixels will be
transmitted to the framebuffer. The corner pixels (xmin,ymin) and
(xmax,ymax) are included in the sub\-rectangle. This option exists
primarily for \fBmged\fP(1) to allow sweeping out a
rectangular portion of the view for ray\-tracing.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-k xdir,ydir,zdir,dist\fP
.RS 4
enables the use of a \fIcutting plane\fP. The
xdir, ydir, zdir, and dist define a plane (equivalent to a halfspace
primitive with the same parameters). The vector (xdir, ydir, zdir) is
normal to the plane and points away from the space to be
subtracted. The dist parameter specifies the distance from the origin
to the plane in the normal direction. The resulting image approximates
subtracting the halfspace from the objects being raytraced. Note that
this is not exactly the same as actually subtracting the halfspace,
but it is faster. If explicit lights are used, objects that are cut
away by the cutting plane will still cast shadows.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-l #\fP
.RS 4
selects lighting model.  Default is 0. Model 0 is a full
lighting model with the ability to implement Phong shading,
transparent and reflective objects, shadow penumbras, texture
maps, etc. In addition to ambient light, a small amount of light is
supplied from eye position. All objects in the active model space with
a material property string of "light" represent additional light
sources (up to 16 are presently permitted), and shadow computations
will be initiated automatically. (This mechanism is subject to further
change.) Model 1 is a diffuse\-lighting model only, and is intended for
debugging. Model 2 displays the surface normals as colors, and is
useful for examining curvature and surface orientation. Model 3 is a
three\-light diffuse\-lighting model, and is intended for
debugging. Model 4 is a curvature debugging display, showing the
inverse radius of curvature. Model 5 is a curvature debugging display,
showing the principal direction vector. Model 6 is for debugging the
UV parameterization used for surface texturing.  It is exactly the
same as applying the texture \(aqtestmap\(aq to every region.  The U
parameter is displayed in the red channel and the V parameter is
displayed in the blue channel. Model 7 is for using photon mapping to
simulate global illumination and caustics in a given scene.  Options
to photon mapping are passed through the \-l parameter in the following
format:
.sp
\-l7,Num_Photons,Caustics_Percent,Irradiance_Rays,Angular_Tolerance,Random_Seed,Importance_Mapping_Toggle,Irradiance_Hypersampling_Toggle,Visual_Irradiance_Toggle,Scale_Lumens,Load_Save_File
.sp
Example: \-l7,16384,0,10,60.0,0,0,0,0,1.0,scene.pm
.sp
Note: If just \-l7 is used, then the default values above will be
applied.  Light sources must also be explicitly defined with lumens
defined for each source, i.e., default light sources will not work.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-n #\fP
.RS 4
defines the height of the image as a number of scanlines.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-o output\fP
.RS 4
specifies the name of a file to store your output data
file. For example, if you specify your output as image.pix, it will
write out an image file in the \fBpix\fP(5) file
format.  If you specify an image.png file, it will write out an image
file in the PNG file format.  The \fBpix\-fb\fP(1)
and \fBpng\-fb\fP(1) utilities can be used to
display ".pix" and ".png" files respectively.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-p #\fP
.RS 4
sets the perspective, in degrees, with 0 < = # < 180
.RE
.sp
\fB\-r\fP
.RS 4
requests that overlapping regions be reported (on by default);
opposite of \fB\-R\fP .
.RE
.sp
\fB\-s #\fP
.RS 4
specifies the number of rays to fire in the X and Y
directions on a square grid. The default size is 512 (i.e., 512 x
512).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-t\fP
.RS 4
causes reversal of the order of grid traversal (default is not
to do that)
.RE
.sp
\fB\-u units\fP
.RS 4
specifies units, with "model" being used for the units of
the local model
.RE
.sp
\fB\-v [#]\fP
.RS 4
sets the output verbosity level for \fBrt\fP.  You can use
\-v 0 for no/minimal output or add \-v repeatedly up through four levels
(e.g., \-vvvv) to see all available output.  Default is all available
output.  The \-v option will also take a specific hexadecimal value to
turn on specific message categories (e.g., \-v 0xFF010030) of output.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-w #\fP
.RS 4
defines the width of each scanline in pixels.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-x #\fP
.RS 4
sets the \fBlibrt\fP(3) debug flags to the
given hexadecimal bit vector. See raytrace.h for the bit
definitions. (Notice that \fB\-! #\fP sets the
\fBlibbu\fP(3) debug flags to the given hexadecimal
bit vector. See bu.h for the bit definitions.)
.RE
.sp
\fB\-z\fP
.RS 4
Enables OpenCL accelerated raytracing (OpenCL must be enabled
at compilation time for this option to be present.)
.RE
.sp
\fB\-A #\fP
.RS 4
sets the ambient light intensity, as a fraction of the total
light in the scene in the range of 0.0 to 1.0 .
.RE
.sp
\fB\-B\fP
.RS 4
turns on the "benchmark" flag. This causes all intentional
random effects such as ray dither, color dither, etc., to be turned
off to allow benchmark timing comparison and benchmark result
comparison.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-C #/#/#\fP
.RS 4
sets the background color to the RGB value #/#/#,
where each # is in the range of 0 to 255 or 0.0 to 1.0. All
non\-background colors will be dithered away from this value.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-D #\fP
.RS 4
This is the "desired frame" flag, specifying the frame number
to start with. Used with animation scripts; specify the desired ending
(kill\-after) frame with \fB\-K #\fP .
.RE
.sp
\fB\-E #\fP
.RS 4
sets the distance from the eye point to the center of the
model RPP; default is the square root of 2. Only useful with
auto\-sizing, and conflicts with \fB\-M\fP .
.RE
.sp
\fB\-F framebuffer\fP
.RS 4
indicates that the output should be sent to the
indicated framebuffer. See \fBlibfb\fP(3) for more
details on the specification of a framebuffer.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-G #\fP
.RS 4
sets the grid cell height, in millimeters. If the grid cell
height is specified and the grid cell width (which would be set using
\fB\-g\fP) is \fInot\fP specified, the grid cell width defaults to be the
same as the height.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-H #\fP
.RS 4
This is the "hypersample" flag, specifying number of extra
rays to fire for each pixel to obtain more accurate results without
needing to store the extra pixels. Automatically invokes \fB\-J
1\fP. The final colors of all rays are averaged together. Better results
can be obtained by simply increasing the resolution, and decimating
the results with a filter such as
\fBpixhalve\fP(1).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-J #\fP
.RS 4
This is the "jitter" flag, which is a bit vector. If one
(\fB\-J 1\fP), it randomizes the point from which each ray is fired by
+/\- one half of the pixel size.  Useful if doing your own
post\-filtering for antialiasing, or to eliminate systematic errors.
This has been useful in obtaining more accurate results in a
volume\-calculating raytrace as well. If two (\fB\-J 2\fP), it shifts
the origin of the output frame once for each frame. The shift is along
a circular path in the plane of the frame, with a period of ten
seconds, and a radius of +/\- 1/4 pixel width. If three (\fB\-J 3\fP),
it performs both operations.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-K #\fP
.RS 4
sets the final (kill\-after) frame number. Used with animation
scripts in conjunction with \fB\-D #\fP .
.RE
.sp
\fB\-M\fP
.RS 4
causes reading of animation (model2view) matrix or animation
script from standard input. Conflicts with \fB\-a\fP and \fB\-e\fP
options.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-N #\fP
.RS 4
sets the NMG_debug flags to the given hexadecimalbit
vector. See h/nmg.h for the bit definitions.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-O output.dpix\fP
.RS 4
specifies the name of a file to store the
double\-precision floating\-point version of the
image. \fBdpix\-pix\fP(1) can be used to later
convert the file to \fBpix\fP(5) format
output. (Deferred implementation)
.RE
.sp
\fB\-P #\fP
.RS 4
specifies the maximum number of processors (in a
multi\-processor system) to be used for this execution.  The default is
system dependent. On "dedicated" multi\-processors, such as
workstations and super\-minis, the default is usually set for the
maximum number of processors, while on shared multi\-processors, such
as SuperComputers, usually just one processor is used by default.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-Q x,y\fP
.RS 4
selects pixel ray for query with debugging.  The option is
used to specify a single pixel for which the debug flags should be
turned on. The computation of all other pixels will be performed
without debugging. This is similar to the \-b option, except that it
does not limit rendering to the single ray.  The entire image is
computed.  This option is useful in debugging problems which arise
from specific computation sequences (such as the order of random
numbers previously drawn).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-R\fP
.RS 4
requests that overlapping regions not be reported; opposite of
\fB\-r\fP .
.RE
.sp
\fB\-S\fP
.RS 4
turns on stereo viewing. The left\-eye image is drawn in red,
and the right\-eye image is drawn in blue.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-T #\fP or \fB\-T #,#\fP or \fB\-T #/#\fP
.RS 4
sets the calculation tolerances
used by \fBlibrt\fP(3). If only one number is
given, it specifies the distance tolerance. Any two entities closer
than this distance are considered to be the same. The default distance
tolerance is 0.005mm. If the second number is given, it specifies the
value of the dot product below which two lines are to be considered
perpendicular. This number should be near zero, but in any case should
be less than 1. The default perpendicular tolerance is 1e\-6. If both
calculation tolerances are provided, they shall be separated by either
a slash ("/") or a comma (","), with no white space between them. For
example, the default tolerances would be specified as
\fB\-T0.005/1e\-6\fP on the command line.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-U #\fP
.RS 4
sets the Boolean variable \fIuse_air\fP to the given value. The
default is 0, which ignores regions that have non\-zero aircode values.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-V #\fP
.RS 4
sets the view aspect.  This is the ratio of width over height
and can be specified as either a fraction or a colon\-separated
ratio. For example, the NTSC aspect ratio can be specified by either
\fB\-V1.33\fP or \fB\-V4:3\fP .
.RE
.sp
\fB\-W\fP
.RS 4
specifies rendering on a white background.  this option sets
the image background color to a nearly pure white RGB of 255/255/254.
This is equivalent to setting \-c "set background=255/255/254".
.RE
.sp
\fB\-X #\fP
.RS 4
turns on the \fBrt\fP(1) program debugging
flags.  See raytrace.h for the meaning of these bits.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-! #\fP
.RS 4
turns on the \fBlibbu\fP(3) library
debugging flags.  See bu.h for the meaning of these bits. In
particular, specifying \fB\-!1\fP will cause \f(CRbu_bomb()\fP to dump core,
rather than logging the error and exiting. This is useful with
\fBdbx\fP(1) or \fBgdb\fP(1) for
debugging. (Notice that \fB\-x #\fP sets the
\fBlibbt\fP(3) debug flags to the given hexadecimal
bit vector. See raytrace.h for the bit definitions.)
.RE
.sp
\fB\-+ #\fP
.RS 4
specifies (setting argument to "t") that output is NOT binary
(default is that it is). \fB\-+\fP is otherwise not implemented.
.RE
.sp
The \fBrt\fP program is a simple front\-end to
\fBlibrt\fP(3) which can be invoked directly, or
via the \fBrt\fP command in \fBmged\fP(1).
.SH "SIGNALS"
.sp
You can obtain progress information from a running \fBrt\fP process
by sending it a SIGUSR1 or SIGINFO signal.  The raytracer will report
progress via details about the ray sample being processed at the time
of the signal.  The progress is reported to stderr in a form similar
to: frame 0, xy=1516,2466 on cpu 0, samp=0
.SH "ANIMATION SCRIPTS"
.sp
For information on the animation script language accepted by
\fBrt\fP, please refer to the manual pages for
\fBtabinterp\fP(1),
\fBtabsub\fP(1), and
\fBanim_script\fP(1). Also please consult the
HTML documentation for a complete animation tutorial.
.SH "NTSC ANIMATION TIPS"
.sp
When using \fBrt\fP to create an animation sequence destined for NTSC
video, it is useful to give all these options at one time:
\fB\-V4:3\fP \fB\-c\fP "set gamma=2.2" \fB\-w1440\fP \fB\-n972\fP
\fB\-J1\fP and then post\-process the output using
\fBpixhalve\fP(1) for final display. Performing
the gamma correction inside \fBrt\fP instead of post\-processing the
\fBpix\fP(5) file with
\fBbwmod\fP(1) avoids Mach\-bands in dark regions of
the image, and retains the maximum amount of image detail.
