= FBHELP(1)

== NAME

fbhelp - provide information on frame buffer selections

== SYNOPSIS

*fbhelp* [-F _framebuffer_]

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*fbhelp* displays information about the selection of frame buffer
devices available to the xref:man:3/libfb.adoc[*libfb*(3)] frame
buffer library and the whole family of _fb_ programs in the BRL-CAD
package, for the machine [cmd]*fbhelp* is run on.

The display device used by a program is taken first from the [opt]*-F*
[rep]_framebuffer_ option if given, else from the environment variable
_FB_FILE_, or finally from whatever the default display is for that
system. [cmd]*fbhelp* will tell you what the available choices of
frame buffers are, as well as detailed information about any options
the currently selected device may have.
