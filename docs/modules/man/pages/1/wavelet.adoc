== NAME

wavelet - perform a haar wavelet decomposition/reconstruction

== SYNOPSIS

*[cmd]#wavelet#* [-1][-2][-d][-r][-# [rep]_channels_][-t[[rep]_c_ | [rep]_d_ | [rep]_f_ | [rep]_i_ | [rep]_l_ | [rep]_s_]][-w [rep]_width_][-n [rep]_scanlines_][-s [rep]_squaresize_][-S [rep]_square_out_size_][-W [rep]_width_out_]<[rep]_file_>[rep]_wavelet_

== DESCRIPTION

The *[cmd]#wavelet#* command will perform Haar wavelet decomposition or reconstruction transforms on the input dataset. The command line options are:

*[opt]#-d#* perform decomposition.

*[opt]#-r#* perform reconstruction.

*[opt]#-1#* perform a 1-dimensional (horizontal) transform.

*[opt]#-2#* perform a 1-dimensional (interleaved horizontal and vertical) transform.

*[opt]#-# channels#* Indicates the number of values in each sample point.  For example, to perform a transform on a xref:man:5/pix.adoc[*pix*](5) file properly, specify "-# 3".  This causes the red, green and blue channels to be transformed individually.

*[opt]#-t {cdfils}#* specifies the data type of the input, and hence the data type in which the wavelet calculations will be performed. The letters each stand for the first character of the C programming language data type: __c__haracter, __d__ouble, __f__loat, __i__nt, __l__ong, __s__hort. Note that if lossless decomposition and reconstruction are desired, then data sets should be converted to the next larger data type before being processed.

*[opt]#-w width#* Specify the number of samples per scanline.

*[opt]#-n scanline#* Specify the number of scanlines in the dataset

*[opt]#-s squaresize#* Specify both width and scanlines simultaneously (square image).

*[opt]#-W width_out#* Specifies the width of the output image.  Normally this is 1 for a full decomposition/reconstruction.  You may specify a width at which decomposition or reconstruction should stop. This number should be a power of 2.  The result will be an "average" image of the specified size, with the remainder of the original data width converted to "detail" coefficients.  See also: -R

*[opt]#-R avg_size#* Resumes a transform that left off with an average image of avg_size.

*[opt]#-S square_out_size#* This is the same as the *[opt]#-W#* option.  It implies the square size for a 2D decomposition limit.

== EXAMPLES

The command [ui]`decompose -# 3 < img.pix | pix-fb` will display the horizontal decomposition of the file img.pix.

The command [ui]`decompose -# 3 -s 1024 -l 64 < img.pix >` will decompose a 1024x1024 image.  The decomposition will stop when the image has been decomposed to 64x64.  The output image will thus have a 64x64 version of the original in the lower left corner of the image, with detail terms in the remainder.
