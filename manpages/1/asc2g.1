.SH "NAME"
asc2g \- convert a BRL\-CAD mged geometry database from ASCII to binary form.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBasc2g\fP \fIinput.asc\fP \fIoutput.g\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBasc2g\fP is a utility provided by BRL\-CAD used to convert
\fBmged(1)\fP geometry databases in ASCII form outputted by \fBg2asc(1)\fP to
the new binary format. The utility will always create the new binary
format, but it will accept either of the two ASCII formats (see
\fIHISTORY\fP).
.sp
The local machine binary representation of a mged database is
inherently non\-portable. \fBasc2g\fP and its converse, \fBg2asc\fP,
are simple filters which convert between the binary form and an ASCII
representation.
.sp
This was traditionally performed so the files could be transferred to
another machine in a portable format.  Although no longer necessary
for the current binary geometry database files that are created by
mged ("v5" format), the conversion process is still necessary if
manipulating older ("v4" format) geometry database files.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 1.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 1." 4.2
.\}
\fBg2asc\fP \fIfile.g\fP \fIfile.asc\fP
.sp
On the local machine, convert the mged databases to ASCII using
\fBg2asc\fP.

.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04' 2.\h'+01'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 2." 4.2
.\}
scp \fIfile.asc\fP remote:\fIfile.asc\fP
.sp
Transfer the converted databases to the remote machine.

.RS 4
.ie n \{\

.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP " 3." 4.2
.\}
ssh remote "\fBasc2g\fP \fIfile.asc\fP \fIfile.g\fP"
.sp
On the remote machine, convert the files back to the binary
representation for that machine using \fBasc2g\fP.
.RE
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fBasc2g\fP does not take any options. However, you have to supply
the input and output files.
.SH "FILES"
.sp
\fIinput.asc\fP is a file previously created using \fBg2asc\fP and
\fIoutput.g\fP is the name of the file where the resulting binary
database should be stored.
.SH "SEE ALSO"
.sp

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.sp
The diagnostics are intended to be self\-explanatory. Any warning
messages are written to standard error.
.SH "BUGS"
.sp
Reports of bugs or problems should be submitted via e\-mail to
\fI\c
.MTO "devs\(atbrlcad.org" "" "\fP."
.SH "HISTORY"
.sp
Release 6.0 introduced a new ASCII format. This format is simply a Tcl
script that, when executed by a simplified geometry command
interpreter (in essence, a properly empowered Tcl interpreter),
rebuilds the database from which it was derived.
.sp
In contrast, the old ASCII format consisted of a sequence of one\-line
records that corresponded to the old database format records.
.SH "DISCLAIMER"
.sp
The ASCII representation of BRL\-CAD geometry databases is not a fixed
format and is allowed to change without deprecation notice. In
general, this will not occur any more frequently than the binary
geometry database format changes, though both are open
specifications. Regardless, the ASCII representation is subject to
change without notice and should not be relied upon by external
codes. (See \fIHISTORY\fP.)
