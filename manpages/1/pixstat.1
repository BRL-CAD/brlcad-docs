.SH "NAME"
pixstat \- list statistics related to a color pix image
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBpixstat\fP [\-v] [\fIfile.pix\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBpixstat\fP will take the given \fBpix\fP(5) format
file, or read from standard in.  A collection of statistics related to
the pixel intensities is produced for each color plane (red, green,
and blue). These include: the number of pixels (and the square root of
this which is the file dimensions if square); the max and min values;
the mean; the median (dividing line where half the pixels are above
this value, half below); the mode (most frequently occurring value)
and the number of pixels at this value; the variance, standard
deviation, and skew.
.sp
The \fB\-v\fP flag will also dump a histogram of the pixel values.
.SH "METHOD"
.sp
Since the pixel values are quantized (each color having discrete
values from 0 to 255), the statistics can be computed from "lump sums"
after building a histogram of the input.  This results in a fantastic
savings in computation while also making a single pass over the input
file sufficient.
