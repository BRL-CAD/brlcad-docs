.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBg\-acad\fP converts the specified \fIobject(s)\fP from a BRL\-CAD
\fIdatabase.g\fP file to the in\-house Lockheed Martin\(cqs Advanced
Computer\-Aided Design \fI(ACAD)\fP file format (formerly the General
Dynamics ACAD file format).  This converter has NOT connected with
Autodesk Inc.\(aqs AutoCAD file format. The \fB\-x\fP option specifies an
RT debug flag and the \fB\-X\fP option specifies an NMG debug
flag. The \fB\-a\fP , \fB\-r\fP , and \fB\-n\fP options specify
tessellation tolerances. The \fB\-D\fP option specifies a
calculational distance tolerance (mm). Any two vertices that are less
than this distance apart will be treated as the same vertex. The
\fB\-v\fP option requests verbose output. The \fB\-i\fP option
requests the output file units to be inches (the default is mm). The
\fB\-o\fP option specifies the name of the file to receive the output
(stdout is the default). The \fB\-e\fP option specifies a file for
receiving the error messages. The \fB\-P\fP option specifies the
number of CPU\(cqs to be used, and also turns on a flag to enable the
receiving of core dumps.
