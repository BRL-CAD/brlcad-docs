.SH "NAME"
pixblend \- blend two pix(5) or bw(5) images
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBpixblend\fP [\-[\fIr\fP | \fIi\fP] \fIvalue\fP] [\-s \fIseedval\fP] [\-S] [\-g \fIgvalue\fP] \fIfile1.pix\fP \fIfile2.pix\fP > \fIout.pix\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBpixblend\fP, given two streams of data, typically
\fBpix\fP(5) or \fBbw\fP(5) images,
generates a "blended" output stream of the same size. This routine
operates on a pixel\-by\-pixel basis, and thus is independent of the
resolution of the image. The type of blending performed is determined
by the following options:
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-r\fP \fIVALUE\fP
.RS 4
This specifies random blending; for each pixel of the
output stream, a number will be chosen uniformly from the interval [0,
1]. If this number exceeds VALUE, then the pixel from the first image
will be output; otherwise, the pixel from the second image will be
output.  Note that if VALUE is 0, then the output will equal the first
image; if VALUE is 1, then the output will equal the second image.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-i\fP \fIVALUE\fP
.RS 4
This specifies linear interpolation; for each pixel of
the output stream, the interpolated pixel ((1.0 \- VALUE) * pixel1
.br
VALUE * pixel2) will be output (where pixel1 and pixel2 are the
corresponding pixels from file1 and file2, respectively).  Note that
if VALUE is 0, then the output will equal the first image; if VALUE is
1, then the output will equal the second image.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-s\fP \fISEEDVAL\fP
.RS 4
Sets the random number seed to SEEDVAL (default is
0).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-S\fP
.RS 4
Instructs \fBpixblend\fP to use bits from the clock as a
random number seed.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-g\fP \fIGVALUE\fP
.RS 4
Tells \fBpixblend\fP to "glitterize" the image; if
the random draw for a pixel is below GVALUE, then the pixel output is
white; otherwise, the pixel used is determined by the ratio set with
the \fB\-r\fP option (see above).
