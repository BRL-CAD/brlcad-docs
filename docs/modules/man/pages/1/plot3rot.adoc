= PLOT3ROT(1)

== NAME

plot3rot - rotate, translate, or scale a UnixPlot file

== SYNOPSIS

*plot3rot* [-x# -y# -z#] [-X# -Y# -Z#] [-s#] [-a# -e#] [-g#] [-M] [-m#] [-v] [-S#] < _unix_plot_ > _unix_plot_

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*plot3rot* will rotate translate or scale a UnixPlot file (see
xref:man:5/plot3.adoc[*plot3*(5)]). Any number of the above options
can be given. Each operation is performed left to right in the order
in which they appear on the command line, and the operations are
concatenated. It is important to note that rotations are not
commutative, so the order they are specified in is important. Typing
the command without any arguments gives a useful summary.

The lower case [opt]*-x# -y# -z#* flags perform a rotation about the
X, Y, and Z axes respectively by the given number of degrees.  A
positive value indicates a right handed rotation.  Upper case
[opt]*-X# -Y# -Z#* are translations along these axes in whatever units
the plot file is in. The [opt]*-s#* flag applies a scale factor up (>
1) or down (< 1) to the plot.

The [opt]*-a# -e#* flags are for azimuth and elevation about the
center point. They are really shorthands for positive Z axis and
negative X axis rotations respectively, and should be used in the
order shown for the proper combined effect to occur.  These flags also
cause the plot to auto-center based on the "space" command in the plot
file, and the new "space" command will be shrunk to fit the rotated
plot as tightly as possible.

The [opt]*-M* flag causes the plot to auto-center based on the "space"
command in the plot file in much the same way that the
xref:man:1/rt.adoc[*rt*(1)] ray tracer does to a model bounding box.
I.e. a sphere is fit to this space and the diameter and center of this
sphere are used as the center and width of the plot in all three
dimensions.  This has the advantage of keeping the entire model in
view from any angle, and is invariant with respect to viewing
direction. It has the disadvantage that the "space" will be enlarged
on every cascaded pass through xref:man:1/plot3rot.adoc[*plot3rot*(1)]
where the [opt]*-M* flag is used.

The [opt]*-S#* flag takes a quoted string of 6 floating point numbers
("min_x min_y min_z max_x max_y max_z"), which are immediately output
as a "space" command, and which override any spaces specified by
"space" commands found in the input file, as well as any spaces which
are computed by translating, rotating, or scaling from those input
spaces as directed by other flags.

The [opt]*-v* flag signals that verbose mode is requested. When set,
the initial transformation matrix is printed. In addition, every time
a _space_ command is encountered in the input file, the old and new
bounding RPP is printed.

The [opt]*-m#* flag takes a quoted string of 16 floating point numbers
as its parameter. This string is a 4x4 rotation matrix (see h/vmath.h
for details). Note that when using this flag, do not use [opt]*-a#,
-e#,* or [opt]*-g.*

UnixPlot is traditionally a first quadrant 2D plotting space with X
increasing to the right of the plot, and Y increasing up the plot. The
"front" of a solid model in the BRL-CAD Package is traditionally
defined by the right handed system of X coming out of the screen
toward you, Y increasing to the right, and Z increasing up the display
(elevation above the XY ground plane).  The [opt]*-g* flag is a
convenient shorthand to transform azimuths and elevations described in
_gift_ notation (as degrees off the front or -X view) into the
UnixPlot coordinate system for display. If used, this option should
usually appear as the last argument, because it acts by modifying the
rotation already established. The [opt]*-g* command has exactly the
same effect as giving [opt]*-z-90 -x-90* in the same place.

== EXAMPLES

The command

....
plot3rot -z30 -x20 < file.plot3 > file2.plot3
....

performs a 30 degree positive rotation about the Z axis (counter
clockwise as viewed from the top), and then translates by 20 units
_along this rotated axis_. If the order of these arguments was
reversed the effect would not be the same.

To view a plot of a model the way one would see it from a ray trace
command, you could use:

....
rthide -a35 -e25 -o file.plot3

plot3rot -a35 -e25 -g < file.plot3 | plot3-fb
....

The final [opt]*-g* converts the _gift_ style azimuth and elevations
into the conventional UnixPlot (screen) X,Y coordinate system.
