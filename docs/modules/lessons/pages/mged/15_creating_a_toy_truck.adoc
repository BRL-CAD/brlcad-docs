= 15. Creating a Toy Truck
:sectnums:
:experimental:

In this lesson, you will:

* Create a toy truck from three shapes.
* Make copies of shapes using the Primitive Editor.
* Make combinations and regions of a more complex object.
* Check the data tree for accuracy.
* List contents of the database.
* Assign material properties using the Combination Editor.
* Identify the difference between OK, Accept, Apply, Reset, Cancel,
  and Dismiss.
* Identify the on-screen help option.
* Identify the stacker option.
* Experiment with the attributes of the camo shader.

In previous lessons, you created and edited shapes to produce simple
objects.  This lesson focuses on creating a slightly more complex
object, a toy truck, from the Command Window.  Your completed truck
should look similar to the following truck:

.Raytraced Toy Truck Design
image::mged/15_truck_design.png[]

Begin by creating a new database called truck.g.

[[_truck_cab_in_cmd]]
== Creating an rpp for the Cab of the Truck Using the In Command

To make the cab of the truck, you will create a right parallel piped
using the in (insert) command.  At the Command Window prompt, type:

[cmd]`in cab1.s rpp kbd:[Enter]`

[app]`MGED` will ask you to enter values for XMIN, XMAX, YMIN, YMAX,
ZMIN, and ZMAX.  Type at the prompt:

[cmd]`0 1 0 1 0 1 kbd:[Enter]`

This will tell [app]`MGED` to:

[%header, cols="6*^", frame="all"]
|===
|0
|1
|0
|1
|0
|1

|Make the value of the rpp's XMIN 0
|Make the value of the rpp's XMAX 1
|Make the value of the rpp's YMIN 0
|Make the value of the rpp's YMAX 1
|Make the value of the rpp's ZMIN 0
|Make the value of the rpp's ZMAX 1
|===

You could also have used the streamlined version of:

[cmd]`in cab1.s rpp 0 1 0 1 0 1 kbd:[Enter]`

A cube shape should appear in the Graphics Window, as follows:

.Wireframe Representation of Shape cab1.s
image::mged/15_truck_cab1s.png[]


[[_truck_hood_in_cmd]]
== Using the Inside Command to Create an rpp for the Hood of the Cab

To make the hood of the cab, you will need to make another rpp shape,
this time using the inside command.  This special command was
originally created to hollow out objects such as gas tanks and boxes;
however, it can be used to create any new shape that has some
relationship to a pre-existing shape.  In this lesson, it is used to
cut away material above the hood and in front of the cab.

If you are using [app]`BRL-CAD` version 6.0 or later, at the Command
Window prompt, type:

[cmd]`inside cab1.s caboff1.s -.1 .7 -.1 -.1 .5 -.1 kbd:[Enter]`

The inside command tells [app]`MGED` to:

[%header, cols="9*^", frame="all"]
|===
|inside
|cab1.s
|caboff1.s
|-.1
|.7
|-.1
|-.1
|.5
|-.1

|Inside the shape
|named cab1.s,
|create rpp called caboff1.s
|Make face 1234 (front) -.1 units thick
|Make face 5678 (rear) .7 units thick
|Make face 1485 (right) -.1 units thick
|Make face 2376 (left) -.1 units thick
|Make face 1265 (bottom) .5 units thick
|Make face 3487 (top) -.1 units thick
|===

[NOTE]
====
In this example, each negative thickness number indicates that
caboff1.s will protrude through the corresponding face of cab1.s.
Running the l (list) command, you can see the vertices for the box it
creates:

....
caboff1.s:  ARB8
	  1 (1.1, -0.1, 0.5)
	  2 (1.1, 1.1, 0.5)
	  3 (1.1, 1.1, 1.1)
	  4 (1.1, -0.1, 1.1)
	  5 (0.7, -0.1, 0.5)
	  6 (0.7, 1.1, 0.5)
	  7 (0.7, 1.1, 1.1)
	  8 (0.7, -0.1, 1.1)
....
====

[NOTE]
====
Note that in older versions of [app]``BRL-CAD``, the faces of an rpp
were numbered in a different order.  So, if your results don't match,
kill caboff1.s and run this command instead:

[cmd]`inside cab1.s caboff1.s .5 -.1 .7 -.1 -.1 -.1 kbd:[Enter]`
====

When in Multipane mode, the design should resemble the following
illustration.

.Truck Cab with Cutof
image::mged/15_truck_cab_cutoff.png[]


[[_truck_cab_wheel_well]]
== Using an rcc to Create a Wheel Well in the Cab

Make a cylinder (rcc) to use for cutting away a space for the first
wheel of the cab.  At the Command Window prompt, type:

[cmd]`make well1.s rcc kbd:[Enter]`

Go to the Edit menu and click on Primitive Selection, then
well1.s.  After selecting a Left view, go back to Edit and select
Scale.  Reduce the size of the rcc until its diameter is about the
right size for a wheel well.  Go back to Edit and select Rotate.  As
discussed previously, one way to easily rotate the rcc is by using the
CTRL key and the left mouse button to drag the top lip of the rcc down
(in a straight line) until the A and C edit labels overlap.  However,
because we know we want to flip the object exactly 90'0 along the x
axis, a better choice is to use the Command Line and type:

[cmd]`p 90 0 0 kbd:[Enter]`

After doing so, you may still have to use the Set H and
Scale editing options to resize and the SHIFT key and left mouse
button to position your wheel well.  When satisfied, select Accept on
the Edit menu.  Your design should look similar to the following in
Multipane mode:

.Multipane View of Truck with First Wheel in Place
image::mged/15_truck_multipane_1stwheel.png[]


[[_ok_accept_apply_reset_cancel_dismiss]]
== The Difference Between OK, Accept, Apply, Reset, Cancel, and Dismiss

The GUI environment of [app]`MGED` offers users several options for
applying, accepting, or rejecting changes made through buttons at the
bottom of dialog pop-up windows.  To use any of these options, just
place the mouse cursor over the desired button and click the left
mouse button.

Selecting the Accept or OK button will tell [app]`MGED` to record the
changes you have made to a shape, region, or combination. [app]`MGED`
uses the Accept and OK buttons interchangeably.  When you select
Accept or OK, the window you are using will automatically close.

The Apply button tells [app]`MGED` to apply a change you have made and
wait for further instructions.  The window does not automatically
close.  This enables you to make changes to several things without
having to reopen the window for each change.

The Reset button tells [app]`MGED` to reset values you have changed in
a dialog box to the last values you applied or accepted.  The Reset
button does not close the dialog box.  The Cancel or Dismiss buttons
discard any changes made in the dialog box and leave values unchanged
from their last stored settings.  These two buttons close the
dialog box.

[[_truck_wheel_well_prim_edit_cpy]]
== Using the Primitive Editor to Make a Copy of the Wheel Well

To make a copy of your wheel well, go to the Edit menu and select
Primitive Editor, which will contain information about the last shape
edited through the dialog box (or myPrimitive if nothing has been
edited). Erase the old shape's name in the Name entry box.  Type in
well1.s and press Reset (or press Enter while the cursor is still in
the Name entry box). The parameter values of the old shape will be
replaced by those of the new shape.  The Primitive Editor will change
and look something like the following example:

.The Primitive Editor
image::mged/15_prim_ed_wheel_well.png[]

Go back to the Name text box and change the 1 to a 2 and click on OK.
Change to Front under the View menu.  Go to Edit/Primitive Selection
and select well2.s.  Use the SHIFT and left mouse button to drag the
new wheel well into position, as shown in the following illustration.
Check your alignment in Multipane mode and then select Accept when you
are finished.

.Placement of the Second Wheel
image::mged/15_truck_2nd_wheel_wheel_place.png[]


[[_truck_cab_shape_comb]]
== Making a Combination of the Cab Shapes

It is now time to make a combination of the various cab shapes.

[cmd]`comb cab1.c u cab1.s - caboff1.s - well1.s - well2.s kbd:[Enter]`

This command tells [app]`MGED` to:

[%header, cols="10*^", frame="all"]
|===
|comb
|cab1.c
|u
|cab1.s
|-
|caboff1.s
|-
|well1.s
|-
|well2.s

|Make a combination
|Name it cab1.c
|Make a union
|of the shape cab1.s
|minus
|the shape caboff1.s
|minus
|the shape well1.s
|minus
|the shape well2.s
|===

Before you go any further, you should check your data tree by typing
tree cab1.c.  The data tree should say:

....
   cab1.c/
   u cab1.s
   - caboff1.s
   - well1.s
   - well2.s
....

If you type ls (list) at the Command Window prompt, you should find
that your database is composed of the combination cab1.c and the
shapes cab1.s, caboff1.s, well1.s, and well2.s.  You will find as you
make more complex objects that you will periodically refer to the list
of the database to ensure it is composed of the elements you want.

[[_truck_body_in_cmd]]
== Creating an rpp for the Body of the Truck Using the In Command

To make the body of the truck, type at the Command Window prompt:

[cmd]`in body1.s rpp 0 2 0 1 0 1.5 kbd:[Enter]`

By now, you should know what this command tells [app]`MGED` to do.  If
you have forgotten, refer back to making the cab of the truck.

Edit the body of the truck so that its front face slightly overlaps
the cab's back face.  Check different views to make sure the body
lines up correctly with the cab.  Accept your changes when you are
done, and then Blast your design.  Your truck should now look like the
following:

.Truck Cab and Body
image::mged/15_truck_cab_body.png[]


[[_prim_ed_wheel_wells]]
== Using the Primitive Editor to Make Two More Wheel Wells

To make two wheel wells for the body of the truck, repeat the steps
used in making the second wheel well.  Name your new shapes well3.s
and well4.s.  Using multiple views, move the new shapes into position
so that your truck now looks similar to the following:

.Wireframe Representation of Truck with Wheel Wells
image::mged/15_truck_wheel_wells_wireframe.png[]


[[_truck_body_wheel_wells_comb]]
== Making a Combination of the Truck Body and Wheel Wells

Make a combination of the truck body and the two new wheel wells.
Name it body1.c.  The tree for body1.c should say:

....
   body1.c/
   u body1.s
   - well3.s
   - well4.s
....

[[_truck_cab_body_region]]
== Making a Region of the Cab and Body

Before adding wheels to the truck, you need to make a region of the
cab and body.  At the Command Window prompt, type:

[cmd]`r truck1.r u cab1.c u body1.c kbd:[Enter]`

[[_truck_wheels]]
== Making Wheels for the Truck

Perhaps the best shape for making wheels is the torus.  You can create
a shape through the Command Window that has the correct size and
placement for your design without further editing.  However, this
lesson is designed to give you practice rotating and translating
shapes.

To make the first wheel, type at the Command Window prompt:

[cmd]`in wheel1.s tor 0 0 0 .5774 .5774 .5774 .18 .08 kbd:[Enter]`

This command tells [app]`MGED` to:

[%header, cols="7*^~", frame="all"]
|===
|in
|wheel1.s
|tor
|0 0 0
|.5774 .5774 .5774
|.18
|.08

|Create a shape
|Name it wheel1.s
|Make the shape a torus
|Make the values of the vertex 0 0 0
|Make the values for x, y, and z of the normal vector .5774 .5774 .5774
|Make the value of the outer radius .18
|Make the value of radius 2 (the tire thickness) .08
|===

Change View to Left and then Edit the position of the wheel.  To
correctly align the wheel with the truck, you will have to Rotate the
tire using the CTRL key and any mouse button.  Scale and Translate the
wheel into position as appropriate and check your alignment from
several different views.  Accept your changes when finished.

Using the Primitive Editor, make the second, third, and fourth wheels.
Move each of these wheels into position until your truck looks like
the following:

.Wireframe Truck and Wheels
image::mged/15_truck_wheels.png[]


[[_truck_wheels_region]]
== Making a Region of the Wheels

Make a region of the four wheels.  When you are finished, your data
tree for wheel1.r should say:

....
   wheel1.r/R
   u wheel1.s
   u wheel2.s
   u wheel3.s
   u wheel4.s
....

[[_truck_regions_mater_props]]
== Assigning Material Properties to the Truck Regions

Your truck is composed of two regions: truck1.r and wheel1.r.  Use the
Combination Editor and select truck1.r.

In the Combination Editor, the camouflage (camo) shader creates a
pseudo-random tricolor camouflage pattern on the object using a
fractal noise pattern.  The shader offers lots of attributes from
which to choose.  For now, select a Background Color of black (0 0 0)
and make Color #1 green (0 134 0), and Color #2 rust brown (164 96
38). To make the pattern design proportional to the truck, select a
Noise Size of .25 and then Apply the selections.  The Combination
Editor window for the camo shader should look like this:

.Camo Shader
image::mged/15_cameo_shader.png[]

Apply a black color and plastic shader to the wheels (wheel1.r) and
click on OK.  Then raytrace your design.

[[_on_screen_help]]
== Using the On-Screen Help Option

You have probably noticed that many of the [app]`MGED` menus offer a
wide variety of options from which to choose.  With so many choices
available, it is easy to forget what a particular selection does.  To
help users quickly access basic information about the various
[app]`MGED` options, the program offers a context-sensitive, on-screen
help feature.

The on-screen help can be accessed from any menu or pop-up window by
placing the mouse cursor over the name of any option in the menu or
window and clicking the right mouse button.  The only place this
feature doesn't work is in the geometry portion of the Graphics
Window, where the design is drawn.

[[_stacker_shading]]
== The Stacker Option

In previous lessons, you applied color and a shader to an object to
make it appear realistic.  Sometimes, however, you will need to apply
two or three shaders to an object to get the design you want.

[app]`MGED` offers three categories of shaders: paint, plastic, and
light.  Any combination of these three types of shaders can be applied
to the same object using the stacker option of the shader menu.

There are three plastic shaders: glass, mirror, and plastic.  A
plastic shader is used to give the perception of space.  It does this
by making the object's surface shiny so that it reflects light.  A
plastic shader is normally applied last in the stacker process.

The paint shaders are used to apply pigment and texture to the surface
of an object.  Color is pigment, and texture is the three-dimensional
quality of the surface material (such as stucco paint).

Pigment shaders include camo, texture (color), texture (black/white),
fake star, cloud, checker, test map, and projection.  Texture shaders
include bump map, fbm bump, and tur bump.  Paint shaders are normally
applied first in the stacking process and are used in combination with
the plastic shader.

The light shader is used to produce illumination in the scene.  This
helps produce realism in the final image.  The light shader is
technically complex and is not discussed in this tutorial.

The camo shader involves applying pigments, in a random pattern, to
the surface of an object.  The camo shader doesn't indicate the
three-dimensional nature of an object.  If you want your design to
show depth, you will need to stack the camo shader and the plastic
shader.

[[_using_stacker_shading]]
== Using the Stacker Option

To use the stacker option, open the Combination Editor and select
truck1.r.  Click on the button to the right of the Shader entry box
and then select stack from the drop-down menu.  A button with the
words Add Shader will appear under the text box.  Click on the button
and then select camouflage.  Set the Background Color to black (0 0
0), Color #1 to green (0 134 0), and Color #2 to rust brown (164 96
38). Make the Noise Size .25.  Click on Add Shader once again and
select plastic.

At this point, your Combination Editor window may have gone off the
bottom of the screen.  If this happens, reduce the size of the window
as much as you can and then drag it up to the top of the screen.  The
buttons at the bottom of the box should now appear, and you can Apply
your selections.

[CAUTION]
====
When using the stacker option, you need to keep track of the number of
characters and spaces in the shader text box. [app]`MGED` versions
prior to release 6.0 will only recognize 64 characters/spaces, so be
careful stacking shaders with complex attributes.
====

[[_truck_combine_regions]]
== Making a Combination of the Truck Regions

To make a combination of the two truck regions, type at the Command
Window prompt:

[cmd]`comb truck1.c u truck1.r u wheel1.r kbd:[Enter]`

[cmd]`B truck1.c kbd:[Enter]`

Your data tree for truck1.c should read:

....
   truck1.c/
   u truck1.r/R
   u cab1.c/
   u cab1.s
   - caboff1.s
   - well1.s
   - well2.s
   u body1.c
   u body1.s
   - well3.s
   - well4.s
   u wheel1.r/R
   u wheel1.s
   u wheel2.s
   u wheel3.s
   u wheel4.s
....

[[_truck_raytracing]]
== Raytracing the Truck

The last step in creating your truck is to raytrace your design.  When
the raytracer has finished, notice that the top and one side of the
truck are very dark.  This is because there is very little light
falling on them.  Because we have not specified any light sources for
our scene, [app]`MGED` provides us with a set of default lights.
These defaults consist of a dim light at the location of the viewer
and a brighter one located to the left and below the viewer.  Since
the primary light is not really shining on one side of the truck, it
is dark.

There is a special adjustment we can make to improve the overall
brightness of the scene.  We can adjust the amount of ambient light,
which is light that does not come from a particular light source but
is a measure of the light generally present in the scene.  To adjust
the amount of ambient light, click on the Advanced Settings button in
the Raytrace Control Panel.  Next to Other Options, type -A .9 and
click Dismiss.  Now when you raytrace, you will get a much lighter
image.
