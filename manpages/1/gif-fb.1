.SH "NAME"
gif\-fb \- display GIF file on frame buffer

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBgif\-fb\fP displays on a frame buffer the images described by a
CompuServe GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) file.
.SS "Options"
.sp
\fB\-F\fP \fIframe_buffer_name\fP
.RS 4
Outputs to the specified frame buffer
instead of the one specified by the \fBFB_FILE\fP environment
variable (or the default frame buffer, if \fBFB_FILE\fP is not
set). The frame buffer size requested will be the same as the input
GIF screen size. The actual size obtained depends on details of the
specific frame buffer.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-c\fP
.RS 4
Uses all 8 bits per channel for color maps supplied in the GIF
file, overriding the color resolution specified in the GIF
file. (While technically a violation of the GIF standard, apparently
some GIF implementations assume this interpretation.)
.RE
.sp
\fB\-i\fP
.RS 4
Displays just the specified image (starting counting with 1),
rather than displaying all images as the GIF specification requires.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-o\fP
.RS 4
(overlay) Skips the initial clearing of the frame buffer to
the background color specified in the GIF file.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-v\fP
.RS 4
(verbose) Also prints information about the GIF images on the
standard error output.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-z\fP
.RS 4
(zoom) Uses the zoom capability of the current framebuffer to
make the image as large as possible on the screen while preserving a
square aspect ratio to the pixels. This means that the zoom factor in
X and Y will be equal to the smaller of the two possible zooms.
.RE
.sp
\fIGIF_file_name\fP
.RS 4
Specifies the GIF input file to be translated,
rather than reading the file from the standard input.
.RE
.SH "DISCUSSION"
.sp
The GIF standard is far from an ideal specification for frame buffer
images, but it has been widely accepted in the personal computer
arena, and consequently there are a large number of images stored in
GIF format on bulletin\-board systems and other information
services. Since most personal computer systems have GIF translators
available for them, \fBgif\-fb\fP provides a means of converting most
images from such systems into a form suitable for processing with
other BRL\-CAD utilities.
.sp
Notice that multiple images within a single GIF file can achieve
animation effects.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.sp
The following is a typical invocation:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
gif\-fb image.gif
.fi
.if n .RE
