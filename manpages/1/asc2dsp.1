.SH "NAME"
asc2dsp \- convert an ASCII dsp file to the BRL\-CAD DSP (Displacement map) binary format
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBasc2dsp\fP \fIfile.asc\fP \fIfile.dsp\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBasc2dsp\fP converts ASCII (decimal integer) cell (point) files to
the binary form of a file in BRL\-CAD\(cqs dsp format.  Pixels are defined
by whitespace\-delimited, unsigned decimal integers in the range 0 to
2^16\-1 (65535).  The output file is in dsp binary format (one network
unsigned short int per cell (point)).
.sp
The grid is oriented in the X\-Y plane where width is in the X
direction and length is in the Y direction.  When used to create a dsp
object im mged, the bottom left cell will have its bottom\-left corner
at X = 0, Y = 0, its bottom at Z = 0, and its top at Z equal to the
value input in the ASCII file.  Note that entries in the ASCII file
are read in the same manner as a pix file, i.e., filling the grid from
bottom to top, left to right, so the first cell defined in the ASCII
file is the bottom\-left cell when the dsp file is imported with
mged. Note also that white space is ignored so the user can lay out
the grid row by row to aid visualizing the end product (always
remembering that the order of the rows will be reversed during input
by mged).
.sp
An easy way to create the input file for asc2dsp is to first create it
row by row in natural form with the top row being the desired top row
and so on in desired viewing order.  Then take the finished file and
filter it through the Unix utility tac which will reverse the order of
the rows (lines).
.sp
Note the user must ensure that the input file is valid for mged so
that width times length equals the actual number of cells (points).

Error conditions include invalid input characters or an input value
greater than 65535. Descriptive messages are printed on stderr.
