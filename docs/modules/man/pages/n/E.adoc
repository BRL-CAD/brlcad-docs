== NAME

E - 
      Display objects in an evaluated form.
    

== SYNOPSIS

*E* {_object_} [-s]

== DESCRIPTION

Displays objects in an evaluated form. All the Boolean operations indicated in each object in _objects_ will be performed, and a resulting faceted approximation of the actual objects will be displayed. Note that this is usually much slower than using the usual [cmd]*draw* command. The _-s_ option provides a more accurate, but slower, approximation. 

== EXAMPLES

Display faceted approximation of an object. 

.Display _objects_ in an evaluated form
====

[prompt]#mged>#[ui]`E some_object`::
Displays a faceted approximation of __some_object__.
