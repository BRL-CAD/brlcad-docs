.SH "NAME"
rthide \- ray\-traces a model and writes a hidden line removed UNIX\-Plot file.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBrthide\fP [\fIoptions\fP]... \fImodel.g\fP \fIobjects\fP... > \fImodel.plot3\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBrthide\fP operates on the indicated \fIobjects\fP in the input
\fImodel.g\fP and produces a hidden line removed UNIX\-Plot file with
bas\-relief features. \fBrthide\fP produces plots by drawing a
boundary whenever a change in region_id is detected.  It also
recognizes and portrays abrupt changes in surface curvature and
changes in surface height.  This permits the recognition of pits,
protrusions, and changes in surface curvature.
.sp
The orientation of the rays to be fired may be specified by the
\fB\-a\fP and \fB\-e\fP options, in which case the model will be
autosized, and the grid will be centered on the centroid of the model,
with ray spacing chosen to span the entire set of
\fIobjects\fP. Alternatively, with the \fB\-M\fP option, a transformation
matrix may be provided on standard input which maps model\-space to
view\-space. In this case, the grid ranges from \-1.0 \(lA X,Y \(lA +1.0 in
view space, with the size of the grid (number of rays fired) specified
with \fB\-s\fP This option is most useful when \fBrthide\fP is being
invoked from a shell script created by an
\fBmged\fP(1) \fIsaveview\fP command.
.sp
The following options are recognized.
.sp
\fB\-s#\fP
.RS 4
Number of rays to fire in X and Y directions (square
grid). Default is 512 (512x512).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-a#\fP
.RS 4
Select azimuth in degrees.  Used with \fB\-e\fP and conflicts
with \fB\-M\fP
.RE
.sp
\fB\-A#\fP
.RS 4
Select angle for shading.  Default is 5.0 degrees. 89.0 will
produce a plot where only steep drops and rises are shaded.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-e#\fP
.RS 4
Select elevation in degrees.  Used with \fB\-a\fP and
conflicts with \fB\-M\fP
.RE
.sp
\fB\-M\fP
.RS 4
Read model2view matrix from standard input. Conflicts with
\fB\-a\fP and \fB\-e\fP
.RE
.sp
\fB\-g#\fP
.RS 4
Select grid cell width.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-G#\fP
.RS 4
Select grid cell height.  If \fInot\fP specified, cell height
equals cell width.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-U #\fP
.RS 4
sets the Boolean variable \fIuse_air\fP to the given value.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-o\fP
.RS 4
\fIoutput.plot3\fP specifies a named file for output. By default,
the plot is written to hide.plot3.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-x#\fP
.RS 4
Set librt debug flags to (hexadecimal) number.
.RE
.sp
The \fBrthide\fP program is a simple front\-end to
\fBlibrt\fP(3) which is most useful when used with
\fBmged\fP(1).
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.sp
This section shows the ordinary usage of \fBrthide\fP. For example,
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
rthide \-a# \-e# \-s32 model.g all.g > file.plot3
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
results in a 32 by 32 UNIXplot file of the named model at the
specified azimuth and elevation.  There will be some cross\-hatching of
the plot based on surface curvature.  In order to minimize this
cross\-hatching, an angle can be specified:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
rthide \-a# \-e# \-s32 \-A89.0  model.g all.g > file.plot3
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
eliminates cross\-hatching due to curvature.  However, cross\-hatching
resulting from sharp changes in gradient cannot be eliminated.
.sp
The plotfile resulting from an \fBrthide\fP run can be viewed
directly via \fIplot3\-fb\fP and may be rotated with \fIplot3rot\fP at the
user\(cqs option:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
plot3\-fb hide.plot3
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
or
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
plot3rot \-a# \-e# \-g hide.plot3 | plot3\-fb
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
or it can be overlaid onto a solid model in \fImged\fP:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
mged> overlay hide.plot3
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
This technique can be used to position and plot \fBrthide\fP output.
.sp
The output of \fBrthide\fP can be overlaid on top of a \fIrt\fP shaded
image, for "edge enhancement".  Here is a complete example, which
assumes that FB_FILE points to a valid framebuffer:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
AZ=35
EL=25
# Directly to the framebuffer
rt \-s512 \-a$AZ \-e$EL moss.g all.g 2> rt.log
rthide \-A89.9 \-s256 \-a$AZ \-e$EL \-o rthide.plot3 moss.g all.g 2> rthide.log
eval `rtregis rthide.log rt.log` < rthide.plot3 | plot3\-fb \-o \-s512
.fi
.if n .RE

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.sp
Numerous error conditions are possible, usually due to errors in the
geometry database. Descriptive messages are printed on standard error
(file descriptor 2).
.SH "BUGS"
.sp
Most deficiencies observed while using the \fBrthide\fP program are
usually with the \fBlibrt\fP(3) package instead.
