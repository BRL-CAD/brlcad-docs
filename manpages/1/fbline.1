.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBfbline\fP draws a line on the currently selected framebuffer
between the points (x1, y1) and (x2, y2). The points must be within
the bounds of the framebuffer, or they are silently limited to an
edge. Use \fBfbpoint\fP(1) to determine where to
position the points. The environment variable FB_FILE specifies the
current framebuffer; see
\fBbrlcad\fP(1). Alternatively, the framebuffer
may be explicitly specified by using the \fB\-F\fP flag.
.sp
By default, the requested framebuffer size is 512x512 pixels.
.sp
The \fB\-S\fP (or \fB\-s\fP) flag sets the width and height to the
same value. The \fB\-W\fP (or \fB\-w\fP) and \fB\-N\fP (or \fB\-n\fP)
flags are used for setting them individually.
.sp
The \fB\-c\fP flag causes the screen to be cleared before the line is
displayed. The default behavior is to draw the line on the current
image without clearing the screen.
.sp
The \fB\-r red\fP , \fB\-g green\fP , \fB\-b blue\fP flags specify
alternate red, green, and blue rgb values for the line color. The
default color is white.  Thus, a green line is created by turning off
the red and green components, i.e., with \fB\-r 0\fP \fB\-b 0\fP
options.
