= PLOT3COLOR(1)

== NAME

plot3color - output a UnixPlot color command

== SYNOPSIS

*plot3color* _r_ _g_ _b_ [<] _unix_plot_ > _unix_plot_

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*plot3color* outputs a UnixPlot command to set the current
drawing color to the given _r g_ and _b_ values.  These values should
be numbers from 0 to 255 and represent black to full up Red, Green,
and Blue values respectively.

To allow this command to be used in pipelines, an optional input file
can be given.  All of the input will be passed through until end of
file, and then the color command will be appended to the end.

This command exists mostly as an aid for making graphs and things from
shell commands.
