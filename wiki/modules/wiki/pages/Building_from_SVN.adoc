= Building from SVN

CAUTION: *BRL-CAD Recently moved from SVN to Github. Building from SVN
works as of 3 Jul 2021, but you may need to build from Github in the
future.*

== Obtain the sources via Subversion

For Windows:

Install a Subversion client for Windows, such as TortoiseSVN:
https://sourceforge.net/projects/tortoisesvn/

To get a checkout after installing TortoiseSVN, right-click in a
folder where you want to download the sources, select SVN Checkout and
specify https://svn.code.sf.net/p/brlcad/code/brlcad/trunk for the
repository
URL.

For Linux/Mac/BSD:

[source,bash]
....
svn checkout https://svn.code.sf.net/p/brlcad/code/brlcad/trunk brlcad
....

NOTE: If you do not yet have an SVN client installed, go to
http://subversion.tigris.org for information on obtaining an
appropriate SVN client for your platform. Most modern Linux/BSD/UNIX
distributions will also have SVN available in their package
repositories.

== Configure the build system with CMake

BRL-CAD also requires the build tool CMake. Most Linux/BSD/UNIX
systems provide a package for CMake. For platforms that do not, CMake
is available from http://www.cmake.org

Once installed, create a directory where you will compile BRL-CAD and
run CMake.

For Windows, you can use the CMake GUI where you specify build and
source directories:

.Running CMake GUI on Windows
image::Running_cmake_on_windows.png[]

For Linux/Mac/BSD, this looks like:

[source,bash]
....
cd brlcad
mkdir build
cd build
cmake ..  # for a default build
cmake .. -DBRLCAD_BUNDLED_LIBS=ON -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release  # for a release build
....

== Compile and test your build

On Windows, simply open the "BRLCAD" solution and Compile.

On Linux/Mac/BSD, run this in your build directory:

`make`

If there are no compilation errors, you can test via:

`make test`

You can also run a performance test:

`make benchmark`

Both the test and benchmark should report successfully if everything
is working correctly. Report any failures to the BRL-CAD
http://sourceforge.net/tracker/?group_id=105292&atid=640802[bug
tracker^].

== Doxygen (OPTIONAL)

If you have doxygen installed somewhere CMake can find it, then you
can build a browsable HTML documentation of the source code. This is
useful if you want to use BRL-CAD's libraries directly, or if you just
want a better overview of how things are structured.

To build the HTML files on a Linux/Mac/BSD system, run (from your
build directory):

`make dox`

and then open doc/doxygen_output/html/index.xhtml with your web
browser of choice.

== Install (OPTIONAL)

On all systems, you can simply run directly from the build directory
without installing.

That said, by default BRL-CAD installs into /usr/brlcad or /opt/brlcad
on Linux/Mac/BSD and into the standard program directory on
Windows. To check your build or install of BRL-CAD, browse to the
"bin" directory from the GUI or from cmd.exe and run "mged".

== Setup environment (OPTIONAL)

At this point, all that remains is setting your system PATH
environment variable so BRL-CAD utilities can be found. Installation
does not set PATH for you automatically.

For Windows, setting PATH can be helpful but isn't necessary. Simply
navigate to where you installed BRL-CAD and run from there.

For Linux/Mac/BSD, you'll either need to specify full paths to
applications (e.g., /usr/brlcad/bin/rt) or set your PATH. If the
default installation prefix (/usr/brlcad or /opt/brlcad) was used, you
should only need to add /usr/brlcad/bin to your PATH in order to find
applications (optionally setting MANPATH as well):

For bash:

[source,bash]
....
export PATH="/usr/brlcad/bin:$PATH"
export MANPATH="/usr/brlcad/man:$MANPATH"
....

For csh/tcsh:

[source,sh]
....
set path=( /usr/brlcad/bin $path )
setenv MANPATH "/usr/brlcd/man:$MANPATH"
rehash
....

To find BRL-CAD manual pages without setting your MANPATH, use the
provided "brlman" binary instead of "man" (e.g.,
/usr/brlcad/bin/brlman rt).

== Test your Build

If compilation went well, there should now be more than 400
command-line applications at your disposal for processing images and
geometry. You should be able to run the main modeling application:

`mged`

If you didn't install, you may need to specify the path to the tool
(e.g., "bin/mged") from the build directory.
