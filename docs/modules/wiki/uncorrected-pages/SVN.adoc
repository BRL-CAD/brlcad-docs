The in-development code for BRL-CAD can be accessed via Subversion using
the command

 svn co https://svn.code.sourceforge.net/p/brlcad/code/<module>/trunk <module>

where +++<module>+++is one of the following:+++</module>+++

* *brlcad* - If you don't know which you want, this is probably it.
This branch contains the code for the full BRL-CAD suite itself,
including tools such as mged and rt.
* *jbrlcad* - A currently inactive experimental project consisting
of a very partial implementation of librt in pure Java. This served
as a study of the adaptability of librt's interface to an object
oriented paradigm, which turned out to be very high.
* *rt{caret}3* - Early development of a C{pp} geometry engine interface and
a new modeling GUI.
* *rtcmp* - Code for a tool to compare the output of librt with that
of other ray tracing libs.
* *web* - Placeholder for version control of the website.

More information about specific branches and the code contained within
them can be had by http://brlcad.org/d/contact[contacting the
