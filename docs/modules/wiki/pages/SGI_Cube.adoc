= SGI Cube

.SGI Cube logo modeled and rendered in BRL-CAD
image::Sgi_cube.png[]

Included below is an example shell script that uses BRL-CAD tools to
procedurally create and render the SGI Cube (tm) logo. The script sets
up functions that create spheres (SPHs) and cylinders (RCCs) going
back and forth in various directions, creating the corresponding
geometry for each of those directions. All of the SPHs and RCCs are
then combined via a Constructive Solid Geometry (CSG) union operation
and material properties are set on the object. The script then sets
the orientation of a view that matches the original SGI logo and
renders to a PNG image file.

== Scripting MGED

BRL-CAD's solid modeling editor, MGED, will run any non-modal modeling
command provided after the name of the geometry database on the
command line. The "-c" option tells MGED to run in classic console
mode. MGED will also run a series of commands piped in or redirected
to it via standard input. This makes scripting MGED in just about any
language rather straightforward. While this example uses a shell
script, it could have just as easily have been written in another
programming language.  BRL-CAD provides a C API to most of the
geometry creation routines via BRL-CAD's libwdb "write database"
library and BRL-CAD's librt ray-trace library.

As some may suspect, it is considerably more efficient to batch multiple
MGED commands together via standard input instead of re-invoking MGED
for each command. The script shown, however, runs MGED multiple times
for each of the various directions merely for the purposes of this
simplified example.

== Results

As should be evident in the result, the rendered cube is pretty close
to the original:

Setting up lights in the scene and testing out other shader parameters
to more exactly match the original SGI cube logo are left as an
exercise to the reader. :-)
