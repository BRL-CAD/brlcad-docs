= SEARCH(nged)

== NAME

search - find and list objects in a BRL-CAD database

== SYNOPSIS

*search* [_options_]... [_path1_] [_path2_]... [_search plan_]...

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*search* works in a fashion similar to Unix-style find commands
(internally it is based on OpenBSD's and NetBSD's find code) but
searches _objects_ in the current open database in MGED rather than
files in a file system. One or more search paths are specified for
searching, and a search plan specifies filters through which objects
in the search paths are tested.  The names of objects satisfying all
of the filters are returned as the command output.

Search Inputs are specified using <<_paths,PATHS>> and matching of
objects is done according to a search plan built using boolean
expressions constructed using the <<_primitives,PRIMITIVES>> and
<<_operators,OPERATORS>> described below. Note that
<<_search_options,OPTIONS>> are not used to form search plans - unlike
the search plan they are specified _before_ the paths and are used to
control settings that apply globally to [cmd]*search*'s behavior and
reporting during the execution of the search.

The results of the search command will be sorted according to David
Koelle's "alphanum" algorithm, which is basically a human-intuitive
ordering for strings with letters and numbers.  For example, a result
returning d1.r, d10.r and d2.r will be sorted as:

....
d1.r
d2.r
d10.r
....

instead of the default ASCII character ordering, which would look
like:

....
d1.r
d10.r
d2.r
....

[[_search_options]]
== OPTIONS

*-a*:: Overrides the hidden flag when assembling path lists, if a
generic toplevel path has been specified.

*-Q*:: Exit quietly without printing error messages if the search plan
contains errors.  Primarily used in situations where programs
automatically generate search invocations.

*-v*:: Prints extra information in full path results.

[[_paths]]
== PATHS:

By default, only the "top level" objects in any search are used as
starting points in the search.  The default mode if no path is
explicitly specified returns a list of all objects found matching the
criteria using the top level objects as inputs.  Specifying paths is
done as follows:

.Path Specifiers
[cols="2*~", options="header"]
|===
| Form
| Results

|/
|Search using top level objects in database as starting points, return
 list of matching full paths.

|.
|Search using top level objects in database as starting points, return
 list of all matching objects.

|\|
|Iterate over all objects in the database without doing a tree walk,
 return list of all matching objects.

|\|/
|Search using every object in the database as a starting point, return
 list of matching full paths.

|\|.
|Search using every object in the database as a starting point, return
 list of all matching objects.

|/objname
|Use object _objname_ as the starting point, return list of matching
 full paths.

|objname
|Use object _objname_ as the starting point, return list of all
 matching objects.

|\|/objname
|Use every object below _objname_ as starting points, return list of
 matching full paths.

|\|objname
|Use every object below _objname_ as starting points, return list of
 all matching objects.
|===

One search command may use multiple paths, each of which can specify
its own mode - such a "mixed mode" search will return a list of full
paths and objects in the order paths were supplied to search.

The "flat" searches that are specified by using '|' as a modifier to
other paths will use every object in the database as starting points
for full tree walks and consequently will be significantly more
expensive for complex tree hierarchies.  The "truly flat" iterative
search triggered by the the stand-alone '|' path specifier will be
faster, but because it does not walk the tree hierarchy depth-related
options (-above, -below, -depth, etc.) will not function.

[[_primitives]]
== PRIMITIVES:

*-attr* _attrib[>/</=val]_:: Returns TRUE if the object has attribute
_attrib_. If a specific value is also supplied for the attribute with
an equal condition, TRUE is returned if the object both has the
attribute and the attribute is set to value _val._ In the case of >,
<, >=, and +++<=+++ there are two possibilities - if _val_ is
numerical a numerical comparison is performed, otherwise a string
comparison is performed. Both _attrib_ and _val_ are treated as
patterns under shell pattern matching rules when a string comparison
is performed, but in numerical mode only the attribute name is pattern
matched.

*-bool* _u/+/-_:: True if the object in question is being combined
into the local hierarchy with the specified boolean operation.
Recognized types are Union (u), Intersection (+), and Subtraction (-).
+
Note that by convention, top level objects are implicitly "unioned"
into the database. To see only objects that have been unioned into a
comb tree without returning the top level comb object as well, use the
[opt]*-mindepth* option to filter for returns deeper in the tree.

*-depth* _[>/</=]depth_:: True if the depth of the object in the tree
is within the range specified.

*-exec* _expression arg1 arg2 ... ";"_:: True if the Tcl expression
returns true. Any pair of curly braces ('{}') in an arguemt is
replaced by the name or full path of the object. The semicolon
terminates the argument list and must not be omitted. Remember to
quote the parameters properly. The semicolon must stand on its own and
must be quoted.
+
When using multiple -exec filters, keep in mind that filters are
evaluated lazily, so if you have two -execs and the first one returns
false for one node, the second one will not run at all.

*-iname* _pattern_:: Like *name* except the match is case insensitive.

*-iregex* _pattern_:: Like *regex* except the match is case
insensitive.

*-maxdepth* _n_:: True if the depth of the object in the tree is less
than or equal to _n_.

*-mindepth* _n_:: True if the depth of the object in the tree is
greater than or equal to _n_.

*-name* _pattern_:: True if the object name (not the full path, just
the name) matches _pattern_. The evaluation is done according to shell
pattern matching rules.

*-nnodes* _n_:: True if the object is a combination and has _n_ nodes.
This option also supports supplying <, >, +++<=+++, and >= in front of
the number to support returning true for objects with node counts less
than, greater than, less than or equal to, and greater than or equal
to _n_.

*-param* _param[>/</=val]_:: Returns TRUE if the object has parameter
_param_.  Unlike [opt]*-attr*, which looks only at general attributes
stored as metadata on objects, the [opt]*-param* filters based only on
the internal geometric object's characteristics. If a specific value
is also supplied for the parameter with an equal condition, TRUE is
returned if the object both has the parameter and the parameter is set
to value _val._ In the case of >, <, >=, and +++<=+++ there are two
possibilities - if _val_ is numerical a numerical comparison is
performed, otherwise a string comparison is performed. Both _attrib_
and _val_ are treated as patterns under shell pattern matching rules
when a string comparison is performed, but in numerical mode only the
parameter name is pattern matched.
+
The following table outlines what parameters are visible to the
[opt]*-param* option.  Because BRL-CAD uses the same internal
containers for some types, some parameters will be present even when
they do not make sense for the specific subtype.  Examples include
using arb8's container for arb4 and tgc for rcc.  Note: there are also
a number of primitives whose parameters are not exposed in a way that
that [opt]*-param* can access them: arbn, ars, brep, bspline, dsp,
metaball, nmg, pipe, pnts, and poly.

*-path* _pattern_:: True if the object path matches _pattern._ The
evaluation is done according to shell pattern matching rules.

*-print*:: Evaluates to TRUE - used to print out the path and name of
the object.

*-regex* _pattern_:: True if the object path matches _pattern_.
Pattern evaluation is done using Regular Expression matching.

*-size* _[>/</=]size_:: True if the size of the object is within the
range specified.  NOTE: for combs, extrudes, and other composite
objects this filter considers _only_ the object definition itself, not
its related elements.

|===
+
As a convenience, the [opt]*-type* option will also recognize the
pattern _shape_, which will match any object that is _not_ a
combination, region, annotation, constraint, grip or joint.
+
In order to identify shapes defined as implicit solids using the
"plate mode" methodology, the pattern _plate_ will match any object
whose internal definition indiciates it is of that type.  Currently
such objects are possible with "bot" and "brep" objects.
+
The the pattern _volume_ can be used as a mirror of plate, in that it
will report objects that clearly define a non-implicit solid volume.
Its determination is local - for example, combs aren't matched because
a comb may be made up of non-volumetric objects.  In particular, plate
mode objects will not match because their volume is implicit, and (for
example) surface mode BoTs will not match because they don't define a
volume.

[[_operators]]
== OPERATORS

*(* _expression_ *)*:: Evaluates to true if the expression inside the
parentheses evaluates to true. Used to establish order of operations.

*-below[>/</=val]* _expression_:: The below operator applies the
expression to every object below the matching object in the tree
hierarchy.  E.g. searching with -below -name start\* on
/component/region.r/start_comb.c/prim1.s would return prim1.s, as the
object below start_comb.c
+
Optionally, inequality and equality constraints on depth can be
appended to the operator to limit what relative depths are accepted as
matches.

_expression_ *-and* _expression_ (a.k.a. -a):: The and operator
operates like the logical AND operator - TRUE only if both expressions
are true.  AND is the default operator assumed if two expressions are
present with no operator explicitly defined.

*-above[>/</=val]* _expression_:: The above operator applies the
expression to every object above the current full path to that object,
and returns TRUE if one or more of them satisfies the expression.
E.g., searching with -above -name s\* on
/component/region.r/start_comb.c/prim1.s would return TRUE for
/component and /component/region.r as start_comb.c is below both of
them, but would return FALSE for any deeper objects (i.e., prim1.s in
this example).
+
Optionally, inequality and equality constraints on depth can be
appended to the operator to limit what relative depths are accepted as
matches.

*-not* _expression_ (a.k.a. !):: The logical NOT operator - returns
the opposite of the evaluation result of expression.

_expression_ *-or* _expression_ (a.k.a. -o):: The logical OR
operator - true if either expression is true.

== A Note on Expressions

All primaries and operands must be expressed as separate arguments to
search. In practice, this means that there must be a space between
each element in a search expression.  E.g. !(-name [a-z] -or -name
[0-9]) must be written as:

  ! ( -name [a-z] -or -name [0-9] )

While this may seem like a rather verbose way of writing the
expression, it greatly simplifies the parsing of the expression and is
standard for virtually all *find* type commands. Because [a-z] and
[0-9] are atomic arguments as far as search is concerned, they should
NOT be expanded in a similar fashion.

== EXAMPLES

The following are run from the MGED command prompt:

.Shell Globbing Based Pattern Match of Object Name
====
[ui]`search -name *.s`

Find all objects in the database with names ending in ".s".
====

.Full Path Instance Reporting of Search Results
====
[ui]`search / -name *.s`

Find all instances of objects in the database with names ending in
".s".
====

.Name Pattern Matching at Depth >= 3
====
[ui]`search / -name *.s -mindepth 3`

Find all instances of objects in the database with names ending in
".s" that are 3 or more levels deep in their tree.
====

.Finding all Objects in a Subtree
====
[ui]`search group1 -name *.r`

Find all objects within group1 in the database that have names ending
in ".r" Note that this will return a list of objects, not the full
path information associated with each instance of the objects matched.
====

.Finding all Instances of Objects in a Subtree
====
[ui]`search /group1 -name *.r`

Find all instances of objects within group1 in the database that have
names ending in ".r" Note that, unlike the previous example, this will
return the full path information associated with each instance of the
objects matched.
====

.Finding all Instances of a Sub-Path
====
[ui]`search / -path \*r245`

Find all paths which end with the object r245.  Note that all paths
generated by objects _below_ r245 will not match this pattern.  To
find all paths with r245 in them, use the following pattern:

[ui]`search / -path \*r245\*`

If you need to match an object path that is potentially ambiguous
(say, r1 when there are lots of regions that match the r1* globbing
rule) add the trailing slash to the expression:

[ui]`search / -path \*r1\/\*`
====

.Searching by Type
====
[ui]`search . -type eto`

Find all objects in the database that are elliptical tori.  Note that
a path of "." produces the same search behavior as the default
behavior for an unspecified path.
====

.Finding all Instances of Nested Regions
====
[ui]`search / -type region -below -type region`

Find all instances of objects of type region that contain a region.
This searches for regions being used within the subtrees of other
regions, which is considered bad practice in BRL-CAD.
====

.Finding all Assemblies
====
[ui]`search / -type comb ! -below -type region ! -type region`

Find all instances of objects of type combination that are not below
regions and are not themselves regions.  These are regarded as
"assemblies" in BRL-CAD.
====

.Finding all Combinations below Regions
====
[ui]`search / -type comb -below -type region ! -type region`

Find all instances of combinations that are not regions and do not
contain regions.
====

.Finding all Empty Combinations
====
[ui]`search -nnodes 0`

Find all combinations containing zero nodes.
====

.Finding all Combinations With 10 or More Nodes
====
[ui]`search -nnodes >=10`

Find all combinations with 10 or more nodes.
====

.Finding all Intersected Objects
====
[ui]`search -bool +`

Find all objects that are combined into one or more trees using the
Intersect boolean operation somewhere in the .g file. This approach
only identifies which objects are intersected somewhere in the tree,
not where specifically they are intersected.
====

.Finding all Instances of Object Intersection
====
[ui]`search / -bool +`

Find all boolean operations that use the Intersect boolean operation
and report the full paths to those objects. This approach reports all
individual cases where an object has been combined into a hierarchy by
intersection, not just which objects have been included with the
intersection operator.
====

.Finding all Unions Within a Comb's Tree
====
[ui]`search /all.g -mindepth 1 -bool u`

Find all unions within the all.g tree hierarchy, excluding all.g
itself.
====

.Finding all Non-Subtracted Regions below Regions
====
[ui]`search / -type region -below -type region ! -bool -`

A more nuanced variation on finding nested regions that adds a check
to make sure that the regions aren't being subtracted.  While not
ideal, using a subtraction does avoid the modeling error of two
volumes claiming the three dimensional space and is arguably
acceptable - the below command finds nested region instances that are
considered errors.
====

.Finding all Regions with RGB color 180 180 180
====
[ui]`search -type region ( -attr color=180/180/180 -or -attr rgb=180/180/180 )`

Prints all regions with their color attribute set to 180/180/180.
Some files may use _rgb_ instead of color, so to be comprehensive an
_-or_ option is used to check both possibilities.
====

.Find All Combs Containing At Least One of Two Objects (dbfind)
====
[ui]`search |. ( -depth 0 -above=1 -name obj1 ) -or ( -depth 0 -above=1 -name obj2 )`

Prints all combs immediately above either obj1 or obj2.  This more or
less mimics the results of the dbfind command, although it will be
somewhat slower (noticably so on large databases.)
====

.Finding all regions containing an intersection of obj2
====
[ui]`search |/ -maxdepth 0 -type region -above ( -name obj2 -bool + )`

Prints all regions immediately above obj2 where obj2 is included using
an intersection operation.
====

.Finding all Plate-Mode BoT Objects
====
[ui]`search -type bot -param mode=plate`

Prints all BoT primitives using "plate" mode, instead of the
closed-mesh-requiring "volume" mode.
====

.Verbose Reporting of Search Information 
====
[prompt]#mged># [ui]`search -v /all.g ! -type comb`

....
/u all.g(c)/u platform.r(r)/u platform.s(arb8)
/u all.g(c)/u box.r(r)/u box.s(arb8)
/u all.g(c)/u cone.r(r)/u cone.s(tgc)
/u all.g(c)/u ellipse.r(r)/u ellipse.s(ell)
/u all.g(c)/u tor.r(r)/u tor(tor)
/u all.g(c)/u light.r(r)/u LIGHT(ell)
....

Report all paths ending in an object that is not a comb using
"verbose" output style. The verbose form of path reporting reports not
just the path, but the boolean operator used at each setp along the
path and the primitive type of each object along the path.
====

.Operating on Sets of [cmd]*search* Results
====
There are two available methods for working with sets of [cmd]*search*
results.  The first is the [opt]*exec* option, which is used in the
following example to search for all regions below subtractions or
intersections in the m35.g example model in BRL-CAD and draw the
objects' wireframes in the display manager:

....	  
mged>search all.g -type region -and ( -below -bool - -or -below -bool + ) -exec draw "{}" ";"
mged>autoview
....

ANOTHER possibility, especially useful for doing multiple sequential
operations which would be awkward to write out in a single search
line, is to assign the results of a search command to a Tcl variable.
To illustrate, let's randomize the colors of all regions in the "cab"
assembly of the m35.g example model and then assign a glass shader
with transparency as a follow-on step.

First, we collect the set of search results into a Tcl variable: 

....
mged> set glob_compat_mode 0
mged> set search_results [search cab -type region]
....

Next we randomize the colors using Tcl's functionality (here we use
random numbers and avoid any value less than 30 to keep objects more
visible):

....
mged> foreach i $search_results {attr set $i color [expr {int(rand()*225)+30}]/[expr {int(rand()*225)+30}]/[expr {int(rand()*225)+30}]}
....

Finally, we add transparency to the same regions:

....
mged> foreach i $search_results {attr set $i shader {glass {tr 0.7 ri 1}}}
....

[NOTE]
====
Remember when setting region colors to check for the presence of a
_regionid_colortable_ attribute on the _GLOBAL object - if such a
table is present (the m35.g sample model has one, for example) you
need to remove that table (and for MGED wireframes, re-open the
database) before the colors on the individual regions will "take":

....
mged> attr rm _GLOBAL regionid_colortable
....
====

== DIAGNOSTICS

Errors will be returned if parsing of the arguments fails, or one of
the primaries' evaluation functions returns an error.
