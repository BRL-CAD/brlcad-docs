= Geometry Service Requirements

* Geometry versioning: revision history of geometry changes such as
who did what to the model and for which analysis, when changes were
made, by whom, etc.
* Direct association of stored geometry with external data
* Multi-user access controls that allow multiple people to work on the
same models at the same time
* Programmable access-controlled interface that utilizes reuseable
code for consistent end-to-end access to geometric data.
* Dynamic geometry
* Geometry articulation and editing constraints
* Unified repository of geometry in one storage location.
* Reuse of identical geometry parts (single instancing).
* Improved/advanced collaboration.

= Identified Executables

* Thin Client
 ** Any Language
 ** Provides:
  *** Communicates with Geometry Engine via GS Protocol
  *** Gui Interface
 ** link:GS_Dev_Thin_Client_Requirements[GS Dev Thin Client
Requirements]

*Geometry Engine

* {blank}
 ** C{pp}
 ** Provides:
  *** Geometry Management (via SVN)
  *** Geometry Conversion, Import, Export
  *** RayTracing
  *** Communications with external Geometry Engines
  *** Communications with external Geometry Repositories
  *** Communications with any other application that implements
the GS Protocol
