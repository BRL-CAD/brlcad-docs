= 3. Using the Insert Command in MGED to Size and Place Shapes
:sectnums:

In this lesson, you will:

* Create a sphere and a right circular cylinder using the make
  command.
* Create the same two shapes using the in (insert) command.
* Combine arguments on the Command Line to streamline the entry of
  variables.
* Develop a combined-command form to help manage Command Line
  variables.
* Consider conventions for choosing names for your objects.
* View your shapes from different perspectives using options of the
  View menu.
* Quit the [app]``MGED`` program.

This lesson focuses on creating shapes from the Command Window using
the make and in commands.  You will create a sphere (sph) and a right
circular cylinder (rcc) using both commands so that you can see how
each command works.  Later in the lesson, you will practice viewing
your model from different angles.

[[_new_db_myshapes]]
== Creating a New Database from the Command Window

Create a new database and name it shapes.g.  Title your database
myShapes.

[[_sphere_make]]
== Creating a Sphere Using the Make Command

Begin by making the Command Window active (usually by clicking
anywhere in the window). Then, at the [app]``MGED`` prompt, type in
the command: `make sph1.s sph [Enter]`

As noted in Lesson 1, this command tells [app]``MGED`` to: 

[cols="1,1,1", frame="all"]
|===

|make
|sph1.s
|sph

|Create a shape
|Name it sph1.s
|Make it a sphere
|===

.Wireframe Sphere
image::mged/03_wireframe_sph.png[]

A sphere shape has now been created, and a wireframe drawing should
appear in your Graphics Window.

To make the rcc from the Command Window prompt, type: `make rcc1.s
rcc[Enter]`

Your Graphics Window should now display a large rcc that, from the
default view of az35, el25, looks as if it intersects the sphere you
previously created.

.Wireframe Sphere and Right Circular Cylinder
image::mged/03_wireframe_sph_rcc.png[]

Using the make command is a fast and easy way to create a shape;
however, most models are going to require shapes that have specific
parameters, such as height and radius.  So, a more precise way to
create these shapes is to use the in (insert) command.

[[_using_in]]
== Using the In Command to Create Shapes

Begin by making the Command Window active (usually done by clicking
anywhere in the window). Then, use the Z (zap) command to clear the
Graphics Window.  You are now ready to create a sphere using the in
command.  At the [app]``MGED`` prompt type: `in sph2.s sph[Enter]`

[app]``MGED`` will respond with: `Enter X, Y, Z of vertex:`

You must tell [app]``MGED`` where to position the vertex (center) of
your sphere in space.  Type at the [app]``MGED`` prompt: `4 4
4[Enter]`

[NOTE]
====
As you work in [app]``MGED``, you will often be asked to enter a value
for a vector or a vertex.  In [app]``MGED``, a vector represents the
distance and direction from one point in space to another, and a
vertex is one single point in space.  The values entered for a vector
are typically used to create an object with specific dimensions.  The
values entered for a vertex place the object in space.
====

Your sphere will now be placed at (x,y,z)=(4,4,4), as measured in
millimeters.  Notice that the numbers are separated by spaces followed
by the ENTER key. [app]``MGED`` will now ask you to:

....

      Enter radius:

      Type in:

      3[Enter]
....

The radius of your sphere will be 3 mm.  The following is the dialog
that should appear in your Command Window (including the appropriate
responses). ` in sph2.s sph```Enter X, Y, Z of vertex: 4 4 4````Enter
radius: 3````51 vectors in 0.000543 sec`` The last line of this dialog
is simply a record of the computer's speed in drawing the shape.  It
has no real usefulness to the user at this point.

A sphere has now been created, and a wireframe drawing similar to the
one created using the make command should appear in your Graphics
Window.

To make the right circular cylinder, type at the Command Window
prompt: `in rcc2.s rcc[Enter]`[app]``MGED`` will ask you to enter
values for x, y, and z of the vertex (where you want the center of one
end of the rcc placed in space). Type: `4 4 0[Enter]` Be sure to leave
spaces between each of these numbers.

[app]``MGED`` will now ask you to enter the x, y, and z values of the
height (H) vector (i.e., how long you want the rcc to be). Type: `0 0
4[Enter]` The last value you will need to enter is the radius of
the rcc.  Type: `3[Enter]` The dialog in the Command Window for the
creation of the rcc should look like this:

....

      mged> in rcc2.s rcc

      Enter X, Y, Z of vertex: 4 4 0

      Enter X, Y, Z of height (H) vector: 0 0 4

      Enter radius: 3

      42 vectors in 0.000214 sec
....

You should now have new versions of the sphere and rcc shapes.  Notice
how these two shapes compare in size to the first two you created.
The rcc is now in proportion to the sphere and is placed in space off
to the left in your Graphics Window.  By specifying the dimensions of
the shapes and their locations in space, you were able to create the
model more precisely.

[[_args_on_one_line]]
== Combining Arguments on One Line

Another way to use the in command is to combine all of the required
information on one line.  Once you become familiar with using the in
command, you will probably prefer to use this method as it allows you
to input all the parameter values more quickly.

Clear the Graphics Window by using the Z command.  Now make another
sphere by typing after the [app]``MGED`` prompt: `in sph3.s sph 4 4 4
3[Enter]`

The meaning of this longer form of the command is: 

[cols="1,1,1,1,1,1,1"]
|===

|in
|sph3.s
|sph
|4
|4
|4
|3

|Insert a primitive shape
|Name it sph3.s
|Make the primitive shape a sphere
|Make the x of the vertex a value of 4
|Make the y of the vertex a value of 4
|Make the z of the vertex a value of 4
|Make the radius a value of 3
|===

To make the right circular cylinder using this method, type after the
[app]``MGED`` prompt: `in rcc3.s rcc 4 4 0 0 0 4 3[Enter]`

The meaning of this command is: 

[cols="1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1"]
|===

|in
|rcc3.s
|rcc
|4
|4
|0
|0
|0
|4
|3

|Insert a primitive shape
|Name it rcc3.s
|Make the primitive shape a right circular cylinder
|Make the x of the vertex a value of 4
|Make the y of the vertex a value of 4
|Make the z of the vertex a value of 0
|Make the x of the height vector a value of 0
|Make the y of the height vector a value of 0
|Make the z of the height vector a value of 4
|Make the radius a value of 3

|Make the shape four units long, pointing straight toward positive z
|===

[[_command_combined_in]]
== Making a Combined-Command Form for the In Command

When you are first starting to use [app]``MGED``, if you want to use
the Command Window rather than the GUI, you may want to make yourself
some blank, combined-command forms for each type of primitive shape
you will be creating.  This can speed up the design process and help
remind you of which values must be entered for each shape.  A form for
the sphere might be:

[cols="1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1"]
|===

|in
|?
|sph
|?
|?
|?
|?

|Insert a shape
|Name of primitive shape
|Type of shape is a sphere
|Value of x
|Value of y
|Value of z
|Radius of sph

|Center
|===

A Combined-Command Form for the rcc might be: 

[cols="1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1"]
|===

|in
|?
|rcc
|?
|?
|?

|Insert a primitive shape
|Name of shape
|Type of shape is a right circular cylinder
|Value of x
|Value of y
|Value of z
|Value of x
|Value of y
|Value of z
|Radius of rcc

|Vertex
|Height vector
|===

[[_mged_naming_conventions]]
== Considering [app]``MGED`` Naming Conventions

You may have noticed that each time you have created a sphere, or rcc,
you have given it a different name. [app]``MGED`` doesn't care what
name you give a shape, but you will find as you develop models that it
helps to have some formula, or conventions, when naming shapes.  Note
also that each name must be unique in the database, and for
[app]``BRL-CAD`` releases prior to 6.0, names are limited to 16
characters in length.

In this lesson, we sometimes assigned names to the shapes based on
their shape type and the order in which we created them.  We did this
because the shapes had no real function, except to be examples.

When you create real-life models, however, you will probably want to
assign names as we did for the radio component names, which were based
on their functions (e.g., btn for button, ant for antenna, etc.).

If you work with more experienced modelers, check with them to see
what set of conventions they use.  If you work alone, develop a set of
naming conventions that works for you and then use it consistently.

[[_view_shapes]]
== Viewing the Shapes

Practice viewing your new shapes using the View menu.  Manipulate your
view using the various mouse-key combinations identified in the
previous lesson.

[[_using_insert_command_quit]]
== Quitting [app]``MGED``

If you wish to quit [app]``MGED``, at this point, type either the
letter q or the word quit after the Command Window prompt and then
press ENTER.  You may also quit the program by selecting Exit from the
File menu.
