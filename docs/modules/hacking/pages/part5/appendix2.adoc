These examples demonstrate some styles and patterns that are used in
the BRL-CAD docs. They might help new doc writers and contributors by
suggesting them what can be used, but they are not meant to be
complete or restrictive.

 `--constant-ident` is specified.

|Specify the material code that will be assigned to all created
 regions (the default is `1`).

NOTE: Because the columns of the table have flexible widths, it is
possible that the options' column is too narrow and the option lines
are broken. To prevent this we are using `[nowrap]` for the longest
option.

 Typically this will be where most of the information about a model is
 reported.

 "footnote" line after the ray has completed its evaluations; once
 per ray.

|*Gap*.  Output written once for each gap the ray may encounter.

== Another way for explaining a command

[source,asciidoc,subs=""]
.....
[[_percent]]
% :: Start a `/bin/sh` shell process for the user.  The
[prompt]#mged># prompt will be replaced by a system prompt for the
shell, and the user may perform any legal shell commands.  The `mged`
process waits for the shell process to finish, which occurs when the
user exits the shell.  This only works in a command window associated
with a tty (i.e., the window used to start `mged` in classic mode).

.Example:
[subs="+quotes"]
....
[prompt]#mged># [in]#%#   <1>
[prompt]#$# [in]#ls -al#  <2>
[prompt]#$# [in]#exit#    <3>
[prompt]#mged>#     <4>
....
<1> Start a new shell process.
<2> Issue any shell commands.
<3> Exit the shell.
<4> Continue editing in `mged`.

== Explaining the usage of a command with definition lists

[source,asciidoc]
....
The g-dxf command converts BRL-CAD objects to the previously mentioned
AutoCAD DXF format.  The syntax for this command is as follows:

`[cmd]*g-dxf* +++[+++[opt]_options_] [rep]#input.g# object(s)`

The options for the g-dxf command are as follows:

[opt]`-i` :: requests the output DXF file to be in inches (default is
millimeters).
[opt]`-o [rep]#output.dxf#` :: specifies the file to receive
the DXF output (default is stdout).
[opt]`-p` :: requests that the output DXF file consist of POLYFACE
MESH entities (the default is 3DFACE entities).

The command also accepts the [opt]`-v`, [opt]`-r`, [opt]`-a`,
[opt]`-n`, [opt]`-x`, and [opt]`-X` options, which have been discussed
in the import converters portion of this document
(xref:tutorials:converting/chapter4.adoc#_sec_convert_to_brlcad[Converting
to BRL-CAD]).

== A manual page example

[source,asciidoc]
......
\include::../header.adoc[]

= B(nged)

== NAME

B - Clears the mged display of any currently displayed objects, then
displays the list of objects provided in the parameter list.

== SYNOPSIS

*B* +[+[-A -o] | _attribute name_ {_value_}...] [-s] [-C +#/#/#+] [-R] [_objects_]

== DESCRIPTION

Clears the mged display of any currently displayed objects, then
displays the list of objects provided in the parameter
list. Equivalent to the [cmd]*Z* command followed by the command
[cmd]*draw* _<objects>_. The _-C_ option provides the user a way to
specify a color that overrides all other color specifications
including combination colors and region id-based colors. The _-A_ and
_-o_ options allow the user to select objects by attribute. The _-s_
option specifies that subtracted and intersected objects should be
drawn with solid lines rather than dot-dash lines. The -R option means
do not automatically resize the view if no other objects are
displayed. See the [cmd]*draw* command for a detailed description of
the options.

== EXAMPLES

The following are run from the MGED command prompt. 

.Display a named object
====
[prompt]#mged># [ui]`B some_object`

The display clears, and the object named _some_object_ is displayed. 
====

.Draw objects having an attribute with a value 
====
[prompt]#mged># [ui]`B -A -o Comment {First comment} Comment {Second comment}`

The display clears, then draws objects that have a "Comment" attribute
with a value of either "First comment" or "Second comment."

NOTE: The asciidoc markup in a _man_ page is kind of restricted. For
example the SYNOPSIS has to start with a star (`*`), otherwise
`asciidoctor` will fail to generate the _man_ page. The markup that is
used in this example can generate both a nice _man_ page and a nice
HTML representation of the _man_ page.
