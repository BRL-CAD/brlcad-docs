== NAME

pixshrink - shrink a color pix file

== SYNOPSIS

*pixshrink*[-s _squareinsize_][-w _in_width_][-n _in_height_][-f _shrink_factor_][-u][_infile.pix_]>_outfile.pix_

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*pixshrink* will take a color xref:man:5/pix.adoc[*pix*(5)] format file of given dimensions and produce a smaller scaled version. The [opt]*-w* and [opt]*-n* flags specify the input file width and number of scan lines in pixels. They can both be set to the same value via [opt]*-s.* Defaults of 512 are assumed for unspecified dimensions. The integer scaling factor ([rep]_shrink_factor_) is set with the [opt]*-f* flag.  By default, the factor is 2.  Thus, pixshrink forms the logical opposite of the __pixinterp2x (1)__ program.

The program reads the entire image into memory, and then scales the image down to 1/[rep]_shrink_factor_ the original size in both dimensions.

By default, pixshrink uses boxcar averaging to produce the output pixels from the input.  The [opt]*-u* option causes pixshrink to use image undersampling instead.

== BUGS

If the dimensions of the input image are not evenly divisible by the shrink factor, incorrect and bizarre output is generated.
