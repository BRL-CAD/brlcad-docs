Voxel data sets are commonly used in computational fluid dynamic
simulations. The current technique for creating voxels from BRL-CAD
geometry is to use the proprietary cubit framework.

This task would involve using raytracing to interrogate a specified
combination/region/assembly and produce a set of arb8's in a new region
approximating the shape. Interface should be similar to the facetize
command and will need the TCL binding to connect the mged editor to the
library functionality.
