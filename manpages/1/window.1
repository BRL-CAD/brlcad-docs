.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBwindow\fP is a program to create a BRL\-CAD database of windows.
Up to twenty\-six windows of the same size may be created.  The windows
are made with rounded corners. \fBwindow\fP uses libwdb to create a
BRL\-CAD database.  The windows are composed of two arb8s and four
cylinders.  This program may be run interactively or the user may
specify options on a command line.  If the user chooses to run the
program interactively, he answers the questions as the program
prompts him.  Below are the options that can be used on the command
line.
