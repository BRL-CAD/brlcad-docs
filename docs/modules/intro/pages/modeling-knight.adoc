Last but not least, it is time to model the knight. I hope till now
you are a little confident while working with dimensions because this
section is going to have plenty of measurements.

Begin by creating a new database named [path]`knight.g`.

The Knight piece can be broken down into four sections: base, body,
neck and the top.  Starting with the base which is same as the other
pieces, type in the MGED command window:

`[in]#in base.rcc rcc 0 0 0 0 0 1.1 2.25#` kbd:[ENTER]

Now, coming to the body. The body section is made up of two shapes;
*arb6* and *rpp*. You are already familiar with *rpp* (Rectangular
Parallelepiped), so let’s get you introduced with *arb6 (Arbitrary
Convex Polyhedron, 6pts)* You will use a shape like the one given
below:

While making this shape using the [cmd]`in` command, MGED will ask you
to enter the values of all six points. The following image gives an
idea of the points:

image::41-arb6.jpg[]

You will use this shape to make the left part of the body section. To
insert this shape, type:

`[in]#in body1.arb6 arb6#` kbd:[ENTER]

MGED will then ask you to enter [rep]`x`, [rep]`y`, [rep]`z` values of
all six points, one by one. Let’s understand each point and its value.

For *point 1*, type

`[in]#0.65 0.5 1.1#` kbd:[ENTER]

For *point 2*, type

`[in]#0.65 0.5 2.9#` kbd:[ENTER]

For *point 3*, type

`[in]#0.65 -0.5 2.9#` kbd:[ENTER]

For *point 4*, type

`[in]#0.65 -0.5 1.1#` kbd:[ENTER]

For *point 5*, type

`[in]#1.75 0.5 1.1#` kbd:[ENTER]

For *point 6*, type

`[in]#1.75 -0.5 1.1#` kbd:[ENTER]

Here,

* `1.75` = radius of _base.rcc_ (`2.25`) - the distance of the body
  from the edge of base (`0.5`)
* `0.5` = half of body’s width
* `1.1` = height of _base.rcc_
* `2.9` = height of _base.rcc_ (`1.1`) + height of body (`1.8`)

To make the other part of the body, type:

`[in]#in body2.rpp rpp -1.75 0.65 -0.5 0.5 1.1 2.9#` kbd:[ENTER]

This is what we get as output:

Moving on to the neck, it also consists of two parts. You will make
two *rpp*. As you look at the target design, the left side of the neck
has a slightly greater height than the right side. So, to make two
*rpp* of different heights, type:

`[in]#in neck1.rpp rpp 0 1.75 -0.5 0.5 2.9 3.7#` kbd:[ENTER]

`[in]#in neck2.rpp rpp -1.75 0 -0.5 0.5 2.9 3.4#` kbd:[ENTER]

The top also has two parts, left and right *arb6*. The left one starts
from the top of `neck1.rpp` and the right one starts at the top of
`neck2.rpp`. Also, the right *arb6* has a height slightly greater than
the left one. To get the shapes, type:

[subs="+quotes,+macros"]
....
[in]#in top1.arb6 arb6# kbd:[ENTER]
[in]#0 0.5 3.7# kbd:[ENTER]
[in]#0 0.5 5.2# kbd:[ENTER]
[in]#0 -0.5 5.2# kbd:[ENTER]
[in]#0 -0.5 3.7# kbd:[ENTER]
[in]#1.75 0.5 3.7# kbd:[ENTER]
[in]#1.75 -0.5 3.7# kbd:[ENTER]
[in]#in top2.arb6 arb6# kbd:[ENTER]
[in]#-1.75 0.5 3.4# kbd:[ENTER]
[in]#0 0.5 5.4# kbd:[ENTER]
[in]#0 -0.5 5.4# kbd:[ENTER]
[in]#-1.75 -0.5 3.4# kbd:[ENTER]
[in]#0 0.5 3.4# kbd:[ENTER]
[in]#0 -0.5 3.4# kbd:[ENTER]
....

****
On a side note, these commands can be written in the shorthand method
with all the values in a single row separated by spaces.

Our Graphics Window looks like this:

image::43-knight-azel-view.jpg[]

And in Left view:

image::44-knight-left-view.jpg[]

Type the following command to make the region:

`[in]#r knight.r u base.rcc u body1.arb6 u body2.rpp u neck1.rpp u
neck2.rpp u top1.arb6 u top2.arb6#` kbd:[ENTER]

Now, assign the material properties to this knight and redraw your
design. Type:

`[in]#mater knight.r plastic 0 0 0 0#` kbd:[ENTER]

`[in]#B knight.r#` kbd:[ENTER]

After raytracing your design looks like:

image::45-knight-rt-azel-view.jpg[]

In Left view:

image::46-knight-rt-left-view.jpg[]

There is a color difference because the part above is plain and the
bottom area is round.
