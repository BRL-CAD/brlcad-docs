== NAME

iges-g - IGES Translator (IGES CSG to BRL-CAD)

== SYNOPSIS

*iges-g*[-X _NMG_debug_flag_][-x _rt_debug_flag_][-N _solid_name_][-b][-n | _d_ | _3_ | _t_]-o _database.g__file.iges_

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*iges-g* converts the specified __file.iges__ to a BRL-CAD __database.g__ file. The IGES file is expected to conform to IGES 5.1. The [opt]*-n* option specifies that all rational B-spline surfaces in the IGES file should be combined into one BRL-CAD spline solid. The [opt]*-d* option indicates that IGES drawings should be converted to BRL-CAD NMG objects. Theses objects will be two-dimensional drawings, not solids. The [opt]*-3* option is the same as the [opt]*-d* option except the final projection into 2D is not performed. This may produce 3D drawings in cases where the drawings have been produced from a 3D model. The [opt]*-t* option requests all the trimmed surfaces in the IGES file be converted to a single BRL-CAD NMG solid. The [opt]*-N* option provides a name to be used for the single solid created under the [opt]*-n* or [opt]*-t* options, and is ignored for other options. The [opt]*-p* option indicates that BREP objects should be converted to NMG solids rather than the default BOT solids. The [opt]*-X* and [opt]*-x* options allow the setting of debug flags for the NMG routines and the rt library respectively. See __nmg.h__ and __raytrace.h__ for details. The absence of any of the [opt]*-n* , [opt]*-d* , or [opt]*-t* options results in the default behavior where all IGES CSG and planar face BREP objects are converted to BRL-CAD equivalents. Most conversions are exact, with the exceptions of the solid of revolution and the solid of linear extrusion. These solids do not exist in BRL-CAD and are therefore approximated. The solid of revolution is built from a series of truncated right cones developed by approximating the curve to be revolved with a series of straight line segments. The extrusion is similarly handled by approximating the curve to be extruded with straight line segments and using that to build a BRL-CAD __polysolid__. Planar faced IGES BREP objects are converted to BRL-CAD NMG structures.
