Tcl (Tool Command Language) is an interpreted language that is
embeddable and highly extensible.  Tk (ToolKit) is a toolkit for
developing user interfaces for desktop applications not only for Tcl,
but for many other languages that run across various operating systems
including Windows, Mac OS X, Linux etc.  Hence when combined, both
create a programming framework that can be used for development and
use of GUI applications.

The most important benefit of using Tcl/Tk is Rapid Development of
applications.  Applications can be implemented 5-10 times faster with
Tcl than any other languages.  Application created with Tcl can be
evolved rapidly to meet the changing requirements.  Some of the other
benefits that make it loved by people are portability, user
convenience.

Tcl/Tk runs on every unix platform.  The deployment of applications
developed using Tcl/Tk is made flexible, powerful and transparent by
using technologies like Tcl virtual file system, starkits and
starpacks.


== What is Tcl/Tk?

* Tool Command Language/ToolKit.
* Tcl is an embeddable and extensible interpreted language. 
* Tk is a toolkit for building user interfaces.
* Combined, they provide a programming system for development and use
  of GUI applications.


== Benefits of Tcl/Tk

* Ease of providing applications with a powerful scripting language
* An excellent "glue language"
* User convenience
* Portability


== Tcl/Tk-Based GUI for MGED

== Tcl Syntax

* A command is a list of words.
* First word on the command line is the command name, any additional
  words are arguments.
+
....
-- command [arg1 ... argn]
....
+
[subs="+quotes"]
....
[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#puts "Hello World"#
Hello World
....

* Words can be grouped with double quotes (" ") or curly braces ({}).
* Commands are terminated with a newline or semicolon.


== Variables

* Variable names are case-sensitive.
* Declarations are not necessary.
* `set _varName [value]_` +
-- Assigns `value` to the variable `varName`.

[subs="+quotes"]
....
[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#set day Friday#
Friday

[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#set day#
Friday

[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#set day 25#
25
....

== Lists

* An ordered set of strings
* Specified with curly braces

[subs="+quotes"]
....
[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#set colors {red yellow green blue}#
red yellow green blue
....

* Sometimes created with "list" command

[subs="+quotes"]
....
[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#set colors [list red yellow green blue]#
red yellow green blue
....

* Can extract elements from the list using the "lindex" command
  (indices start at zero)

[subs="+quotes"]
....
[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#lindex {red yellow green blue} 2#
green
....

== Arrays

* Uses associative arrays
** -- Strings used to index the array elements

[subs="+quotes"]
....
[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#set profit(January) 1500#
1500

[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#set profit(February) -200#
-200

[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#set profit(January)#
1500
....

== Special Characters

Dollar sign `$` :: Substitutes the value of the variable
Square brackets `[` `]` :: Replaces contents with the result of
  evaluating the command
Backslash `\` :: Allows special characters such as newlines, [, and $
  to be inserted without being treated specially
Double quotes `"` `"` :: Allows special characters to be processed
  normally
Curly braces `{}` :: Disables special characters
Parentheses `()` :: Delimits key values in arrays
Hashmark `#` :: At the beginning of a line, signifies a comment to
  follow


== Special Character Examples

[subs="+quotes"]
....
[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#set name Elvis#
Elvis

[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#puts "Hello name"#
Hello name

[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#puts "Hello $name"#
Hello Elvis

[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#set len [string length $name]#
5
....

* -- string length $name returns 5
* -- len gets the value 5


== Special Character Examples (cont'd)

[subs="+quotes"]
....
[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#set price 1.41#
1.41
[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#puts "Gasoline: \$ $price/gallon"#
Gasoline: $1.41/gallon
[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#puts {Gasoline: \$ $price/gallon}#
Gasoline: \$ $price/gallon
[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#set product 1; #This is a comment#
1
....

== Special Character Conflicts

* MGED traditional "name globbing" characters conflict with Tcl/Tk
  usage:
** -- MGED follows Unix shell filename patterns.
** -- Tcl/Tk has different interpretation of * and [].
* Users can select which interpretation of special characters:
** .mgedrc: set MGED variable 
** glob_compat_mode
** set glob_compat_mode 0 (for Tcl evaluation)
** set glob_compat_mode 1 (for object name matching)
** Menu: File->Preferences->Special Characters

== Expressions

* The `*expr*` command is used to evaluate math expressions.

[subs="+quotes"]
....
[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#expr 2 + 2#
4

[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#expr (3 + 2) * 4#
20

[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#in ball.s sph 0 0 0 [expr 3 + 4]#
....

-- A sphere is created with a vertex (0,0,0) and a radius of 7.

== Control Flow

[subs="+quotes"]
....
if {test} {body1} [else {body2}]

[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#set temp 90#

puts "It's hot"
} else {
puts "It's moderate"
}

== MGED Commands

[subs="+quotes"]
....
get obj[attr]
Returns a list of the object's attributes. If attr is specified,
only the value for that attribute is returned.

[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#get foo.r#
comb region yes id 200 los 100 GIFTmater 2 rgb {100 100 100}

[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#get foo.r rgb#

....

== MGED Commands (cont'd)

* adjust obj attr value[attr value] 
** Modifies the object's attribute(s) by adjusting the value of the
   attribute(s) to the new value(s).
* ls [-c -r -s] 
** Without any options, lists every object in the database. 
** With the "c" option, lists all nonhidden combinations; "r" option
   lists all nonhidden regions; and "s" option lists all nonhidden
   primitives.

== The "source" Command 

* source _fileName_
** Reads and executes the file as a Tcl script.
* Create the file with a text editor.
* Reload the file with "source" changes are made.
* The proc or the source command can be placed in .mgedrc.


==  MGED Defaults 

* Create the default .mgedrc from inside MGED:

image::mged-defaults.png[]


== MGED Customization 

* Placed in the file .mgedrc in local directory or home

[source]
----
############### MGEDRC_HEADER ###############
# You can modify the values below. However, if you want
# to add new lines, add them above the MGEDRC_HEADER.
# Note - it's not a good idea to set the same variables
# above the MGEDRC_HEADER that are set below (i.e., the last
# value set wins).
# Determines the maximum number of lines of
# output displayed in the command window
set mged_default(max_text_lines) 1000

== [incr Tcl/Tk] 

* Object-oriented extension to Tcl.
* Provides support to build large programs. 
* New applications in BRL-CAD are being written in [incr Tcl/Tk].
