== NAME

pix-sun - convert a BRL PIX(5) format image to a Sun Rasterfile format

== SYNOPSIS

*pix-sun* [-d] [-s _squaresize_] [-w _file_width_] [-n _file_height_] < _BRLpixfile_ > _rasterfile_

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*pix-sun* converts the _BRL PIX(5)_ format file on the standard
input to a _Sun Rasterfile_ format file on the standard output.  The
rasterfile produced is a "standard" (as opposed to "byte encoded")
image, with 8 bits per pixel, with a palette of 256 colors.

== OPTIONS

*-d*:: use a dither map

*-n file_height*:: tells [cmd]*pix-sun* that the input is
_file_height_ scanlines tall

*-s squaresize*:: sets both the width and the height for the input to
be _squaresize_

*-w file_width*:: tells [cmd]*pix-sun* that the input is _file_width_
pixels wide
