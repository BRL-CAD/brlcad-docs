[[_pipe_general_use]]
== General Use

. *Fewer primitives and Booleans.* One pipe primitive can effectively
represent hundreds of cylinders and tori with their associated
subtraction and bounding primitives. This means fewer parameter values
to define and simpler regions.
. *Easier editing.* Because the pipe is just one primitive, extending
it, hollowing it out, or otherwise changing its parameters can be
easily and efficiently performed without having to edit many
primitives. Unfortunately, seemingly simple edits to combined geometry
can often require not-so-simple changes/calculations associated with
the underlying primitives.

Although a pipe is a single primitive (regardless of how long it is
and how many bends it has), geometrically, it is effectively a series
of cylinders connected by torus sections.  As illustrated in Figure
A-1, the pipe must have a minimum of two end points (shown in
blue). Between the end points can be any number of other points (shown
in red) to designate bends in the pipe or changes in pipe diameter.
All points (including end points) contain information to define the
bend radius, outer diameter, and inner diameter.

To build a pipe, points can be appended after a given point, prepended
before a given point, moved, or deleted; and the parameters at each
point can be independently edited at any time.

One potentially confusing aspect of the pipe is that bend points do
not always lie along the pipe's path.  This is because the bend radius
dictates the path of the pipe between points.  As shown in Figure A-2,
which depicts the same pipe with three different bend radii, a small
bend radius means the bend point will be closer to the path of the
pipe, and a large bend radius means the point will be farther away.
Also, because a bend is computationally equivalent to a section of
torus, each point is constrained to accept only those bends that are
consistent with the parameters of a torus (e.g., the user cannot
specify a bend radius that is so small that it violates the defined
characteristics of a torus).

In addition, because they are defining turns, points in a pipe are
often nonlinear.  However, as shown in Figure A-3, collinear points
can also be used when a modeler simply wants to achieve a tapered or
"stepped" inside or outer diameter on a straight-running tube.
Examples of other potential uses include a notched axle on a vehicle,
a pressed gear fitting, and a tapered end on a garden hose.

Nonetheless, it is good modeling practice to build your pipe with only
those points needed to define its shape.  It is not necessary to add
extra collinear points along a long straight section of pipe.  Note
too that pipes are not required to have hollow volume in them at all.
The modeler can set the inner diameter to 0 and achieve a solid shape.

Modelers should remember that when a pipe is made with the `make` or
`create` command, the default values for the previously listed
parameters are based upon the size of the view in the graphics window
when the pipe is first created.  This is important because modelers
can sometimes find themselves unable to move or delete certain points
due to relatively large bend radii (e.g., that might have been
established when the pipe was first created in a relatively large
graphics window). These large radii constrain the shape and prevent it
from accepting mathematically invalid commands (e.g., a larger inner
diameter than outer diameter or an unacceptably tight bend radius).

[[_pipe_make_coil]]
== Making a Coil

In addition to using the pipe primitive to make tubular objects such
as electrical and hydraulic lines, it can be used to make other types
of objects.

Consider, for example, the building of a wire coil.  The pipe
primitive can reduce the complexity of the process by avoiding some of
the difficulties associated with combining geometry.

The main challenge of using the pipe to build a coil is to locate
where the points should be in order to achieve the properly
dimensioned geometry.  We can start with the following measured
dimensions:

. *Diameter of the coil* - The critical measurement here is the
center-to-center measurement. It is difficult to measure this
directly, but it can be easily derived from an outside-to-outside
measurement by subtracting the wire diameter.
. *Diameter of the wire* - This will define the outer diameter (or
gauge) of the pipe.
. *Height per coiled section* - The best way to derive this
measurement is to take a total measurement of the coil sections and
divide by the number of turns. This will ensure the total height and
number of turns are correct and will allow one to measure to the
tolerance of his tool with minimal error.

In the example shown in Figure A-4, the coil diameter is 1/4 (0.25)
in, the wire diameter is 1/32 (0.03125) in, and the height of each of
the 10 coil sections is 7/32 (0.21875) in.

The key to properly and precisely positioning points to build a coil
section is to use half of the coil diameter as an offset.  The first
and the last points in the coil must lie on the pipe's path.  These
points are easily determined at 90° intervals from the center of the
pipe (or, with a bit of trigonometry, at any interval). The rest of
the points for the pipe are located at ± offsets in whichever plane is
perpendicular to the pipe height vector from the center of the pipe
with the proper height delta (which will generally be 1/4 of the
height per coil section).

Obviously, the construction of this type of object is a little more
advanced than the construction of many of the other types of objects
discussed.  Thus, the following text provides the user with
step-by-step instructions that can also serve as a kind of template
when using the pipe primitive to build a coil or similar object.

To build two turns of a coil at the origin with a coil diameter of
1000 mm, a wire diameter of 200 mm, and a coil height of400 mm
(running along the +Z axis), the user would perform the following
steps (or ones similar to them):

. Set the units to millimeters using the `units` command on the
  command line (`mged> units mm`) or the Units option in the
  graphical user interface (GUI) (menu:File[Preferences > Units]).
. Set the screen size to 2000 using the `size` command (`mged> size
  2000`) and center the screen at 0 0 400 using the `center` command
  (`mged> center 0 0 400`).
. Create a pipe named spring.s1 using the `make` command (`mged> make
  spring.s1 pipe`) from the command line or the Create option from
  the GUI. Select the pipe for editing using either the `sed` command
  (`mged> sed spring.s1`) or the Enter Primitive Name dialog box.
. With the default pipe in edit mode, set the diameter of the wire. To
  do this, first set the inner diameter of the wire to 0 by using the
  Edit menu's Set Pipe ID option and the `p` command on the command
  line (`mged> p 0`). Next, set the outer diameter to 200 using the Set
  Pipe OD option and the p command (`mged> p 200`). (Be sure to set the
  Pipe inner diameter [ID] and outer diameter [OD], not the Point ID
  and OD.)
. Set the pipe bend to 500 mm using the Edit menu's Set Pipe Bend
  option and the `p` command (`mged> p 500`).
. Translate the pipe to coordinate 0 500 0 by selecting the Edit
  menu's Translate option and the `p` command (`mged> p 0 500 0`).
. Choose the Edit menu's Select Point option and use the center mouse
  button to click on (or near) the top of the pipe segment.
. Move the top end point to 500 500 50 using the Edit menu's Move
  Point option and the `p` command (`mged> p 500 500 50`).
. Add points at the following coordinates using the Edit menu's Append
  Point option and the `p` command (the visual effect for each of the
  commands is shown to the right of each command):

.Important Points to Remember About the Pipe
[NOTE]
====
* Even the end points of a pipe have a bend radius (although it is not
  used unless the point is changed to an interior point).
* Each bend radius value must be greater than half the value of its
  corresponding outer diameter.
* The pipe primitive does not have to be used for hollow tubes. The
  inner diameter can be 0, making the object solid.
* The bend radius at each point constrains the pipe in such a way that
  the path of the pipe often touches only end points, not those in
  between.
* BRL-CAD will not allow points to be added, deleted, or moved if the
  result of such actions would create pipes with mathematically
  invalid characteristics.
* Points may not be coincident; they must be offset by at least
  0.0001 mm.
* When modeling a tube with fluid inside of it, model both the tube
  and fluid as solid pipes and subtract the fluid from the tube.
