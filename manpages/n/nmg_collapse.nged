.SH "NAME"
nmg_collapse \- Simplifies an existing nmg_shape by a process of edge decimation.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBnmg_collapse\fP {\fIold_nmg_shape new_nmg_shape maximum_error_dist\fP} [\fIminimum_angle\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Simplifies an existing \fInmg_shape\fP by a process of edge
decimation. Each edge in the \fIold_nmg_shape\fP is considered; if it can
be deleted without creating an error greater than the specified
\fImaximum_error_dist,\fP then that edge is deleted. If a \fIminimum_angle\fP
is specified (degrees), then the edge will not be deleted if it would
create a triangle with an angle less than \fIminimum_angle\fP. The
resulting shape is saved in \fInew_nmg_shape\fP. The \fIold_nmg_shape\fP must
have been triangulated previous to using the \fBnmg_collapse\fP
command. The resulting shape consists of all triangular faces.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
The example shows the use of the \fBnmg_collapse\fP command to
simplify an existing nmg shape by decimating its edges. The new nmg
shape will be within a maximum error distribution and will not have
any triangles with angles less than a given minimum.
.sp
.B Example 1. Create a new nmg shape by decimating the edges of an existing nmg shape.

.sp
mged> \f(CRnmg_collapse nmg_old nmg_new 1.0 10.0\fP
.sp
Decimates edges in \fInmg_old\fP to produce an NMG with an error no
greater than 1.0 units. The process will not create any triangles with
an angle less than 10Â°. The new NMG shape will be named \fInmg_new\fP.
