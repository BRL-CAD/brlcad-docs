== NAME

g-dot - BRL-CAD to DOT language converter

== SYNOPSIS

*g-dot* [-o _output.dot_] _database.g_ _object(s)_

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*g-dot* converts the specified _object(s)_ from a BRL-CAD
_database.g_ file to the _DOT_ language format. The [opt]*-o* option
specifies an output .dot file (writes to stdout by default).

The DOT language format is a plain text format for describing
graphs. Programs like Graphviz, Tulip, OmniGraffle, and others can
render .dot files (such as those produced by [cmd]*g-dot*) as images.

== EXAMPLE

....
$ g-dot -o sample.dot sample.g sample_object
....

== DIAGNOSTICS

Error messages are intended to be self-explanatory.
