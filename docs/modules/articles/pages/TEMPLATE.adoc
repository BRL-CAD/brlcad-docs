[[_some_descriptive_tag]]
== Unknown Title!

First paragraph goes here. 

[cmd]`benchmark TIMEFRAME=1 run`

[NOTE]
====
The preceding [app]`benchmark` command example can get a lot more
complex.
====

When you run the `benchmark` with the [option]`help` option, you
might see this output:

[subs="quotes"]
....
[prompt]#sean@gcc1-power7 bin]$# [cmd]#benchmark help#
[output]##Usage: ./benchmark [command(s)] [OPTION=value] [RT_OPTIONS]

Available commands:
clean
...##
....

Another paragraph with embedded list is shown here.  Each paragraph
gets its own para and should be wrapped for readability and localized
context diff comparisons.

* Bullet item 1. 
* Bullet item 2.

== Breaking up the flow into sections

You can use sections to group sections of your document together, but
they are not necessary.

These examples demonstrate some styles and patterns that are used in
the BRL-CAD docs. They might help new doc writers and contributors by
suggesting them what can be used, but they are not meant to be

=== Another table that explains some options

.STL reader options
[cols="2*~", frame="none"]
|===
|`--binary`
|Specify that the input file is in binary STL format (the default
 assumes ASCII).

|[nowrap]`--starting-ident=[var]#number#`
|Specify the starting ident for the regions created. The default is
 `1000`. This number will be incremented for each region, unless
 `--constant-ident` is specified.

|`--constant-ident`
|Specify that the starting ident should remain constant.

|`--material=[var]#code#`
|Specify the material code that will be assigned to all created
 regions (the default is `1`).

NOTE: Because the columns of the table have flexible widths, it is
possible that the options' column is too narrow and the option lines
are broken. To prevent this we are using `[nowrap]` for the longest
option.


=== Using bibliography references

....
The COMGEOM target descriptions are processed by the Geometric
Information For Targets (GIFT <<r1>>,<<r2>>) code for use in follow-on
vulnerability assessment codes.

|Event
|Description

|r
|*Ray*.  A ray is cast.  The formatting associated with r will print
 regardless of whether a region is encountered.

|h
|*Header*. First output after a ray hits anything.  Formatting at
  *h* is output once per ray.

|p
|*Partition*.  Output for each region encountered by the ray.
 Typically this will be where most of the information about a model is
 reported.

|f
|*Footnote*.  Last output statement after a ray hits anything; a
 "footnote" line after the ray has completed its evaluations; once
 per ray.

|g
|*Gap*.  Output written once for each gap the ray may encounter.

|m
|*Miss*.  If triggered, prints a message that nothing was hit;
 maximum once per ray.

|o
|*Overlap*.  Output written once for each overlap along the
 ray.

=== Another way for explaining a command

[subs=""]
.....
[[_percent]]
% :: Start a `/bin/sh` shell process for the user.  The
[prompt]#mged># prompt will be replaced by a system prompt for the
shell, and the user may perform any legal shell commands.  The `mged`
process waits for the shell process to finish, which occurs when the
user exits the shell.  This only works in a command window associated
with a tty (i.e., the window used to start `mged` in classic mode).
+
.Example:
[subs="+quotes"]
....
[prompt]#mged># [cmd]#%#   <1>
[prompt]#$# [cmd]#ls -al#  <2>
[prompt]#$# [cmd]#exit#    <3>
[prompt]#mged>#     <4>
....
<1> Start a new shell process.
<2> Issue any shell commands.
<3> Exit the shell.
<4> Continue editing in `mged`.

=== Explaining the usage of a command with definition lists

....
The g-dxf command converts BRL-CAD objects to the previously mentioned
AutoCAD DXF format.  The syntax for this command is as follows:

`[cmd]*g-dxf* +++[+++[opt]_options_] [var]#input.g# object(s)`

The options for the g-dxf command are as follows:

[opt]`-i` :: requests the output DXF file to be in inches (default is
millimeters).
[opt]`-o [var]#output.dxf#` :: specifies the file to receive
the DXF output (default is stdout).
[opt]`-p` :: requests that the output DXF file consist of POLYFACE
MESH entities (the default is 3DFACE entities).

The command also accepts the [opt]`-v`, [opt]`-r`, [opt]`-a`,
[opt]`-n`, [opt]`-x`, and [opt]`-X` options, which have been discussed
in the import converters portion of this document
(xref:tutorials:converting/chapter4.adoc#_sec_convert_to_brlcad[Converting
to BRL-CAD]).
