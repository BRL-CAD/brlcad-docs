As changes are implemented in BRL-CAD, ARL developers run a standard
set of computationally intensive image files (shown in Figure 2) on a
common machine in order to benchmark and compare raytrace performance.
In addition, these images are provided with each source distribution
of the package so that users can also test performance on their
machines, if desired.

To run the benchmark images, run the script run.sh in the "bench"
directory of the source directory tree.
