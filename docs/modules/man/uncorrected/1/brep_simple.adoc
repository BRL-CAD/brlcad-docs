== NAME

brep_simple - constructs a simple boundary representation (b-rep) twisted cube

== SYNOPSIS

*brep_simple*

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*brep_simple* constructs a simple b-rep twisted cube directly using the openNURBS API. The constructed twisted cube is written to a geometry database (brep_simple.g) using the wdb interface. The cube is constructed by first defining and creating the vertices, then the twisted edges (using trimming curves), and finally the faces to get a final topology like the following:
