== NAME

pixbustup - break up concatenated pix images into separate files

== SYNOPSIS

*pixbustup*_basename__width_[_image_offset_][_first_number_]<_input.pix_

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*pixbustup* takes input consisting of a concatenated collection of xref:man:5/pix.adoc[*pix*(5)] format files and breaks them up into separate files.  The output file names will be of the form __basename.num__, where __basename__ is given on the command line, and __num__ is a consecutive series of integers.  By default the first image will be made number " 0 ", but an alternate __first_number__ can be given. The images must be square and the width (and height) is given by __width__. The program keeps reading these small files until end of file is reached. If one does not wish to extract from the beginning of the input file, an __image_offset__ can be given which will skip that number of images before beginning.

This program is mostly a holdover from the days when xref:man:1/rt.adoc[*rt*(1)] wrote animations into one huge file, but it is still sometimes useful.
