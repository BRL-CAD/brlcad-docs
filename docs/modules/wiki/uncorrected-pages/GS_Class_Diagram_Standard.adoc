= Notes on Class Diagrams

* Once Use Cases have initially been grouped together, then Classes
need to be identified.
* Categorize classes into _entity_, _boundary_, or _control_.
 ** Entity classes contain long term data.
 ** Boundary classes interface with actors.
 ** Control classes encapsulate a use case's behavior.

* Classes are drawn as boxes with 3 divisions:
 ** (top)Class name
 ** (mid)Attributes (or members, or fields)
 ** (bottom)Methods (or functions)
* Arrows between Classes indicate an association
 ** Numbers on each end of the line indicate Multiplicity.
  *** Example: The line between Student and Enrollment has a 1 on
the student side and a 1..* on the Enrollment side. This
simply means that 1 Student Object can have 1 to inifinite
amound of Enrollment objects. Read the other way, it means
that any of many Enrollment objects can only have 1 Student
object each.
 ** The direction of the arrow indicates 'knowledge of.'
  *** Example: *Student* has knowledge of *Enrollment* but
*Enrollment* objects have no knowledge of *Student*
objects.
* Text descriptions written on the Arrow help add understanding to the
association.
 ** Example: A *Student* is _enrolled_, via an *Enrollment*
object, _in_ a *Seminar*.
