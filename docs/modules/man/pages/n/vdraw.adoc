= VDRAW(nged)

== NAME

vdraw - Allows drawing of lines and polygons (optionally with per
vertex normals) in the MGED graphics display. It is used to build a
named list of drawing commands for MGED, send the list to the MGED
display, modify the list, or delete all or part of the list.

== SYNOPSIS

*vdraw* {_command_} [_args_]

== DESCRIPTION

Allows drawing of lines and polygons (optionally with per vertex
normals) in the MGED graphics display. It is used to build a named
list of drawing commands for MGED, send the list to the MGED display,
modify the list, or delete all or part of the list. All vertices in
the _vdraw_ command are in millimeters. The MGED drawing commands are
represented by integers in the _vdraw_ command. The MGED drawing
commands and the integers that _vdraw_ uses for them are:

.Drawing Commands
[cols="3*~", frame="all", options="header"]
|===
| MGED Drawing Command
| Vdraw integer
| MGED Action

|RT_VLIST_LINE_MOVE
|0
|Begin a new line at this point

|RT_VLIST_LINE_DRAW
|1
|Draw line from previous point to this point

|RT_VLIST_POLY_START
|2
|Start polygon (argument is surface normal)

|RT_VLIST_POLY_MOVE
|3
|move to first polygon vertex 

|RT_VLIST_POLY_DRAW
|4
|Subsequent polygon vertices 

|RT_VLIST_POLY_END
|5
|Last polygon vertex (should be same as first)

|RT_VLIST_POLY_VERTNORM
|6
|Vertex normal (for shading interpolation)
|===

The [cmd]*vdraw* commands are as follows: 

* open -- with no arguments, this returns "1" if there is a open list;
  "0" otherwise. If an argument is supplied, a command list is opened
  with the provided name.
* write -- with arguments of _i c x y z_, the MGED drawing command
  [cmd]*+++#+++c* is placed in the _ith_ position of the command list
  with the vertex as (_x y z_).
+
-- with arguments of _next c x y z_, the command is placed at the end
   of the list.
* insert -- with arguments of _i c x y z_, the MGED drawing command
  _+++#c+++_ is inserted just before the _ith_ position of the command
  list.
* delete -- with an integer argument of i, the _ith_ command is
  deleted.
+
-- with an argument of "last", the last command on the list is
   deleted.
+
-- with an argument of "all", all the commands on the list are
   deleted.
* params -- with an argument of _color rrggbb_, the color of all
  objects on this list is set. The _rrggbb_ is a hex number
  representing the color, "ffffff" is white, "ff0000" is red, "00ff00"
  is green, etc.
+
-- with a single string argument, the name of the current list is
   changed.
* read -- with an integer argument of _i_, the _ith_ command is
  returned.
+
-- with an argument of "color", the current color is returned.
+
-- with an argument of "length", the number of commands in the current
   list is returned.
+
-- with an argument of "name", the name of the current command list is
   returned.
* send -- send the current command list to the MGED display manager.
* vlist -- with an argument of "list", return a list of the names of
  all existing command lists.
+
-- with an argument of _delete list_name_, delete the specified
   command list.

All textual arguments may be abbreviated by their first letter.

== EXAMPLES

The eight examples show the use of the [cmd]*vdraw* command with four
different commands and various arguments to build a list of commands
to draw a square.

.Open a specified list.
====
[prompt]#mged># [in]`vdraw open square`

Opens a list named _square_.
====

.Set the color.
====
[prompt]#mged># [in]`vdraw params color ff00`

Sets the color to green. 
====

.Start a line at the origin.
====
[prompt]#mged># [in]`vdraw write next 0 0 0 0`

Starts a line at the origin. 
====

.Draw a line from the previous point to a specified point.
====
[prompt]#mged># [in]`vdraw write next 1 100 0 0`

Draws a line from the origin to (100 0 0). 
====

.Draw a line from the previous point to a specified point.
====
[prompt]#mged># [in]`vdraw write next 1 100 100 0`

Draws a line from the previous point to (100 100 0). 
====

.Draw a line from the previous point to a specified point.
====
[prompt]#mged># [in]`vdraw write next 1 0 100 0`

Draws a line from the previous point to (0 100 0). 
====

.Draw a line from the previous point to the origin.
====
[prompt]#mged># [in]`vdraw write next 1 0 0 0`

Draws a line from the previous point to the origin. 
====

.Send the command list to the display manager.
====
[prompt]#mged># [in]`vdraw send`

Draws the square in the MGED display. 
====
