.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBpixfilter\fP applies one of several 3x3 kernel filters to a color
\fBpix\fP(5) format file. It will take a file name or
else read from standard input. The input file size will be assumed to
be 512 by 512 pixels unless the \fB\-w\fP, and/or \fB\-n\fP, or the
\fB\-s\fP flags are used to tell it otherwise. By default a low pass
filter is used.  The \fB\-f\fP \fItype\fP flag can be used to specify
a different type of filter.

Most filters divide the result of the kernel multiplication by some
value in order to scale it back to a 0\(->255 range. For example, the
boxcar divides by nine.  The \fB\-d\fP flag can be used to change this
divisor. Some filters also add an offset to their results.  The output
of a laplacian for example is "centered" about zero, thus it adds 128
to the answer to yield a difference from neutral grey. The \fB\-o\fP
flag can be used to change this offset.
.sp
The \fB\-v\fP flag displays the kernel values on standard error.
