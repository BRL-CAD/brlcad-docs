10.Go to the BRL-CAD bin directory and give the command to turn you obj
file into a .g file. This command exports the obj-formatted file to a .g
file. The syntax of the obj-g command is

`>obj-g input.obj output.g  `

Don't forget to enter a path for your files. To see all the uses of the
obj-g command just enter "`obj-g.`"

11.Open mged. You will see two windows, a command window that is white
and a graphics window that is black.

16.Do you remember what the table looked like when we were done with it
in Blender? It was upside down and now it's on its side. Rotating the
table reorients it correct way. To reorient your table the right way,
enter these commands in the command window:

` sed default.1.1.b.c.s `

` accept `
`{| border="0"`
