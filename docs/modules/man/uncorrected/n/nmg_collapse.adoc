= NMG_COLLAPSE(nged)

== NAME

nmg_collapse - Simplifies an existing nmg_shape by a process of edge
	decimation.
   

== SYNOPSIS

*nmg_collapse* {_old_nmg_shape new_nmg_shape maximum_error_dist_} [_minimum_angle_]

== DESCRIPTION

Simplifies an existing _nmg_shape_ by a process of edge decimation. Each edge in the _old_nmg_shape_ is considered; if it can be deleted without creating an error greater than the specified _maximum_error_dist,_ then that edge is deleted. If a _minimum_angle_ is specified (degrees), then the edge will not 	be deleted if it would create a triangle with an angle less than __minimum_angle__. The resulting shape is saved in __new_nmg_shape__. The _old_nmg_shape_	must have been triangulated previous to using the [cmd]*nmg_collapse* command. The resulting 	shape consists of all triangular faces. 

== EXAMPLES

The example shows the use of the [cmd]*nmg_collapse* command to simplify an existing nmg 	shape by decimating its edges. The new nmg shape will be within a maximum error distribution and will 	not have any triangles with angles less than a given minimum. 

.Create a new nmg shape by decimating the edges of an existing nmg shape.
====
[prompt]#mged>#[ui]`nmg_collapse nmg_old nmg_new 1.0 10.0`

Decimates edges in _nmg_old_ to produce an NMG with an error no greater than 1.0 units. The process will not create any triangles with an angle less than 10Â°. The new NMG shape will be named __nmg_new__.
