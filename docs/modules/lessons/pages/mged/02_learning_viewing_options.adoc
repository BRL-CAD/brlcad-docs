= 2. Learning Viewing Options in MGED
:sectnums:
:experimental:

In this lesson, you will:

* Create a model radio.
* Locate viewing information in the Command Window.
* Identify elements of the [app]`MGED` viewing system.
* View your radio from different angles.
* Work with Shift Grips.

Models in [app]`BRL-CAD` are constructed in a single xyz coordinate
system, which we sometimes refer to as model space.  The Graphics
Window of [app]`MGED` displays a portion of this space.  The xyz
coordinate system is used for specifying both the geometry and the
view of the geometry that is presented in the Graphics Window.

[app]`MGED` offers a default view and a variety of optional views.
You can switch back and forth between these views during and after
model creation.  This lesson is designed to help you understand the
viewing process and options.

[[_creating_radio]]
== Creating a Radio

To gain practice viewing actual geometry, let's build a simple
geometric object-a "walkie-talkie" radio.  Note that the commands we
use to do this are not discussed here because our current concern is
on applying the principles of viewing.  Later lessons on creating
geometry address these commands in detail.  Begin by launching
[app]`MGED` and creating a new database named radio.g.  Remember that
one way to do this is to type the following command in a Terminal
Window:

[cmd]`$ mged radio.g`

Type the following in the Command Window, carefully checking each line
before pressing ENTER.  If you make a mistake, use BACKSPACE or the
left/ right arrow keys to make corrections before pressing ENTER (see
Appendix B for the editing command list).

[NOTE]
====
Be especially careful to note the difference between the numeral one
[1] and the letter l [l] in ell1 on the third line.

[NOTE]
====
Note that in the preceding Command Line expressions, btn is an
abbreviation for button, ant is an abbreviation for antenna, and spkr
is an abbreviation for speaker.  Also note that the numbers could have
been separated by single spaces.  The extra spaces were inserted
simply to improve readability.  For some usages (e.g., the r and comb
commands, which are discussed later), the number of spaces has to be
exact.

An image similar to the following should now appear in the Graphics
Window.

.Default View of a Radio

[[_locating_viewing_info_cmd_window]]
== Locating Viewing Information in the Command Window

Now take a minute to look at the Command Window.  Even if nothing is
in the window, enclosed in the bottom border is a string of
information about the Graphics Window.  An example string might read:
`cent=(8.000 16.000 24.000) sz=96.000 mm az=35.00 el=25.00 tw=-0.00
ang=(0.00 0.00 0.00)`

As detailed in the following table, this information contains four
groups of viewing data about the Graphics Window.

[[_viewing_system_elements]]
== Identifying Elements of the [app]`MGED` Viewing System

=== Center of View

The first set of information tells you the center of what you are
viewing.  You can change the center of where you are looking through
both the GUI and the Command Window.

To change the center of your view of the radio using the GUI, press
the SHIFT key and any mouse button while dragging the mouse.  (This is
an example of a Shift Grip, which is described later in this chapter.)
You can also change the center of view by placing the mouse pointer
where you want the center to be and clicking the middle mouse button.

To change the center of view using the Command Window, simply type at
the prompt the word center followed by three values for x, y, and z
(which is the 3-D coordinate system mentioned previously). For
example:

[cmd]`center 0 15 325.735 kbd:[Enter]`

As you change your view of the geometry, notice that the numbers in
the brackets after the cent= title will change to reflect the new
center of the view.

=== Size of View

The size of the view is the amount of model space that is shown in the
Graphics Window.  For example, consider using a camera with a zoom
lens to photograph a rose.  As shown in the following figures, if you
zoom in on the rose, it will appear large in relation to your viewing
field.  If you zoom out, it will appear smaller.  In actuality, the
view size for the rose image on the left might represent only 15 mm
across while the view size for the image on the right might represent
100 mm across.  In both cases, however, the actual size of the rose is
the same.

[cols="1,1", frame="none"]

|image:mged/02_flower_zoomout.png[]

|Zoom In to View Details (small size of view)
|Zoom Out to View Object in Relation to Environment (large size of
 view)
|===

To change the view size of your radio through the GUI, click the right
mouse button to zoom in and the left mouse button to zoom out.  Each
time you click the left or right mouse button, the view of the design
will increase or decrease in size by a factor of 2 (i.e., two times
larger or two times smaller than the previous size).

You can also zoom in or out on your design by going to the View menu
and selecting Zoom In or Zoom Out.  A drawback to this method is that
you can only zoom in or out one time because the drop-down menu closes
once you make a selection.

If you get lost at any point while creating a model, you can use the
zap (Z) command to clear the geometry from the Graphics Window and
then recall the shape with the draw command.  When drawing in an empty
Graphics Window, [app]`MGED` automatically sizes the view to fit what
you draw into the window.

You can control the view size of your radio more accurately with the
Command Window.  To set the size to 100 (of whichever units you have
selected), type at the prompt:

[cmd]`size 100 kbd:[Enter]`

You can also zoom in or out on a design by typing zoom on the Command
Line.  To make your radio appear 50% smaller, you would type:

[cmd]`zoom 0.5 kbd:[Enter]`

To make your radio appear twice as large, you would type:

[cmd]`zoom 2 kbd:[Enter]`

[NOTE]
====
Remember that changing the view size does NOT affect the size of the
object.  You will change the size of an object in Lesson 6.
====

=== Angle of View

Azimuth, elevation, and twist (all measured in degrees) determine
where you are in relation to the object you are viewing.  Azimuth
determines where you are around the sides of it (i.e., to the front,
left, right, behind, or somewhere in between), elevation determines
where you are above or below it, and twist determines the angle you
are rotated about the viewing direction.

To better understand azimuth, imagine walking around a truck with a
camera to photograph it.  As shown in the following illustrations, you
would be at 0'0 azimuth if you stood directly in front of the truck to
take its picture.  If you circled around slightly to your right, you
would be at 35'0 azimuth.  If you moved further around until you were
looking directly at the driver's side (in U.S.  trucks), you would be
at 90'0 azimuth.  Standing behind it would put you at 180'0 azimuth.
If you were facing the passenger's side, you would be at 270'0
azimuth.

[NOTE]
====
The terms azimuth, elevation, and twist are similar to the terms yaw,
pitch, and roll, respectively, which are common terms in the aerospace
industry.

|Right (az=270, el=0)

Elevation, on the other hand, involves the viewer's position above or
below an object.  In the preceding example, you circled around a truck
without changing your relative height.  You had an elevation of 0'0,
which means you were level with it.  As the following figures
illustrate, however, imagine stopping at the 35'0 azimuth position and
then climbing a ladder to photograph the truck from 25'0 elevation.
Climbing higher, you would be at 60'0 elevation.  If you were directly
above it with the camera facing down, you would be at 90'0 elevation.
If you crawled under the truck and looked directly up at it, you would
be at -90'0 elevation.

[cols="1,1", frame="none"]

|image:mged/02_truck_270_-90.png[]

|Top (az=270, el=90)
|Bottom (az=270, el=-90)
|===

Finally, twist (which is an optional setting in [app]``MGED``)
specifies a rotation about the viewing direction.  This rotation is
applied to the view after azimuth and elevation have been designated.
So, returning to our truck example, imagine standing in front of the
vehicle (az=0, el=0) and then tilting your camera counterclockwise
14'0.  This would give your view a 14'0 twist angle, as shown in the
following figure (on the left). Note again that it is not the truck
that is tipped up, but simply your view of it.  For more information
on specifying twist, see the [cmd]`ae` command in Appendix A.

[[_coord_sys_summary]]
== Summing up on Azimuth and Elevation and the xyz Coordinate System

As mentioned at the start of this lesson, [app]`MGED` operates in a
three-dimensional coordinate system (determined by the x, y, and z
axes). Azimuth is measured in the xy plane with the positive x
direction corresponding to an azimuth of 0'0.  Positive azimuth angles
are measured from the positive x axis toward and past the positive y
axis.  Negative azimuth angles are measured in the other direction.

.Azimuth, Elevation, and the xyz Coordinate System
image::mged/02_coordsys.png[]

If the azimuth angle is 0, then elevation is measured in the xz plane
with +90'0 corresponding to the positive z direction and -90'0
corresponding to the negative z direction.  However, if azimuth is not
0, these angles are in a plane aligned with the azimuth direction.

[[_view_radio_angles]]
== Viewing Your Radio from Different Angles

Let's now experiment with different views of your radio. [app]`MGED`
has several standard default views, which you've already seen in the
preceding truck example.  They include Top (az270, el90); Bottom
(az270, el-90); Right (az270, el0); Left (az90, el0); Front (az0,
el0); Rear (az180, el0); az35, el25; and az45, el45.

Go to the View menu and try viewing your radio from different angles. 

[cols="1,1", frame="none"]

|Top
|az35,el25

|image:mged/02_radio_right.png[]
|image:mged/02_radio_front.png[]

|Right
|Front
|===

You can also select any azimuth-elevation combination from the Command
Line.  For example, at the prompt type

[cmd]`ae 128 17 kbd:[Enter]`

As with many of the Command Line options, this method of selecting
views provides a finer degree of control/precision when you need it.

[app]`MGED` can also display multiple views simultaneously.  Go to the
Modes menu and select Multipane.  Four small panes with different
views should appear in your Graphics Window, as shown in the following
illustration.

.Multipane View of the Radio
image::mged/02_multipane.png[]


[[_shift_grips]]
== Working with Shift Grips

The Shift Grip options of [app]`MGED` are handy hot-key and mouse
button combinations that can be used in two different ways.  With
regard to our present discussion on viewing, the Shift Grips can, in
effect, "drag" the world around in front of the viewer (but without
actually changing the coordinates of the viewed objects). The same
Shift Grips can also be used in Edit mode to actually move or alter
the geometry of your objects.  In both cases, the Shift Grips appear
to do the same thing, so it is important always to know the mode in
which you are operating.

In general, the SHIFT key translates (moves), the CTRL key rotates,
and the ALT key constrains (or limits) translation or rotation to a
particular axis (x, y, or z). These axes correspond to the three mouse
buttons as follows: the left button represents the x axis, the middle
button represents the y axis, and the right button represents the z
axis.  In addition, the SHIFT and CTRL keys can be used in conjunction
with any mouse button to scale an object (although the ALT key will
not constrain this action). The following table lists all of the key
bindings and their functions.

.Shift Grip Keys and Effects

|===

[CAUTION]
====
Depending on your window manager or desktop environment settings, some
key combinations may already be designated to perform other tasks
(e.g., resizing or moving a window). If so, you may need to adjust
settings to allow the Shift Grip options to function.  Furthermore,
left-handed users may have switched the behavior of the left and right
mouse buttons in their system configurations.  In such instances, the
terms left mouse button and right mouse button should be switched
throughout this document.
====

Probably the easiest way to familiarize yourself with the Shift Grip
options is to try them out on your radio.  Using the preceding table
as a guide, experiment with translating, rotating, constraining
translation and rotation to particular axes, and sizing your radio
view.

[NOTE]
====
Remember, although the Shift Grip options may appear to be
manipulating objects, unless you are in Edit mode they are only
manipulating your view of the objects.
