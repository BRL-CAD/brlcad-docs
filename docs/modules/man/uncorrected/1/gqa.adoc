== NAME

gqa - a BRL-CAD quantitative geometry analysis tool

== SYNOPSIS

*gqa* [_options_] _model.g_ _objects_

== DESCRIPTION

The [cmd]*gqa* program computes and reports a variety of characteristics of the _objects_ specified from the given _model.g_ geometric description. The characteristics which can be computed include *weight, volume, overlaps, exposed air, gaps/voids,* and *adjacent air.* Only the _objects_ from the database specified on the command line are analyzed. 

It works by shooting grids of rays from the three axis-aligned directions (sometimes called __views__). 

For volume/weight calculations the resulting calculations for each view are compared to each other. The grid of rays is progressively refined until the results from all three views agree within a user-specifiable tolerance, or a limit on grid refinement is reached. 

For error and interface calculations, the grid is refined until an error is found or the grid refinement limit is reached. 

When multiple calculations are performed, the most extensive path is taken. For example, if weight and overlap calculations are performed, then the grid will be refined until the refinement limit is reached, or an overlap is detected. 

== VOLUME AND WEIGHT CALCULATION

If volume or weight calculation is selected, a value is calculated and reported for each _object_ specified on the command line. *Note that if there are overlaps or other errors in the
      geometry, the values reported will be invalid.*

For weight computation, the density of every region must be specified. Densities are specified as an index in a table of density values. This index is stored in the _GIFTmater_ attribute of each region (typically set with the _edcodes_ or _adjust_ commands in MGED). 

The density table consists of three columns: 

__An integer index value__.::
This is the value to which the _GIFTmater_ attribute will be set to select this material for the region. 

__A floating point density value__.::
This is the density for the material, and is specified in **grams/cc**. 

__A name string__.::
This is a name or description the material. 

This information may be stored in the .g file or as a separate density file. 

To check if the .g file you are using has a density table, use the [cmd]*mater -d get ** command to see if any information is already defined (if no density information is found, an error message will be returned.)  If no pre-existing information is available, a density table may be defined in an external file using a text editor. (Alternately, it may also be built up within MGED directly using the [cmd]*mater -d set* command.) 

An example file might look like the following: 

To import an existing density file into the database, use the [cmd]*mater -d import* command: 

[prompt]#mged>#[ui]`mater -d import [rep]_filename_`

If existing density values need to be corrected in the .g file, the [cmd]*mater -d set* command may be used to alter them.  For more about density information manipulation, see the xref:man:N/mater.adoc[*mater*(N)] manual page. 

The geometry editor MGED automatically assigns an index value of `1` to a newly created region. While this default can be handy when a vast majority of objects are made from the same material, it can lead to surprising errors when objects which are supposed to have a certain weight are computed to have different weight because one or two regions were not set to the correct, nondefault index value.  As a result, it is advised that the index value `1` never be used. If this practice is followed, then an error message will be generated for any regions which have not had their material index set to something other than the default. 

== GEOMETRY ERROR DETECTION

All of these calculations run until an error is detected, or until the grid refinement limit is reached. 

== OVERLAP DETECTION

For each pair of regions that overlap, the tool reports the two regions that overlap, the maximum line-of-sight thickness of the overlap, and the in-hit location of the ray that caused that maximum overlap thickness. 

Other analyses in the error detection category behave in a similar manner. 

== OPTIONS

*-A*__analysis_flags__::
Specifies which computations are to be performed and reported. The _analysis_flags_	    parameter is one or more of the following: 
+

[cols="1,1", frame="all", options="header"]
|===
| value
| report generated


|A
|all

|a
|Adjacent different air

|b
|Bounding box dimensions

|e
|Exposed air

|g
|Gaps/voids

|m
|Weight + Centroids + Moments of Inertia

|o
|Overlaps

|v
|Volume

|w
|Weight
|===
+
Only those reports requested will be provided. The default is [opt]*-A A*, to produce all reports. 
+
*Adjacent different air (a):*	    Detects air volumes which are next to each other but have different air_code values applied to the region. This would typically indicate that the regions are different types of air, such as crew_air (which fills the crew compartment of a vehicle) and engine_air (which surrounds the engine). When these different types of air adjoin each other, it is generally considered a modeling error. 
+
*Bounding box dimensions (b):*	    Reports the dimensions of an axis-aligned box which fully encloses the __objects__. 
+
*Exposed air (e):*	    This causes checks to be made to see if the ray encounters air regions before (or after all) solid objects. It also checks to see if the ray moves from a void to an air region. Typically, only the air inside a building or vehicle is modeled if the purpose of the model is to support analysis of that single structure/vehicle.  There are exceptions, such as when modeling larger environments for more extended analysis purposes. 
+
*Gaps/voids (g):*	    This reports when there is more than _overlap_tol_dist_	    (see the [opt]*-t* option below) between objects on the ray path.  Note that not all gaps are errors.  For example, gaps between a wheel and a fender are expected (unless external air is modeled).  Typically, users should perform gap analysis on contained subsets of a model (such as passenger compartments) rather than on whole vehicles. 
+
*Overlaps (o):*	    are two regions which occupy the same space.  In the real world, two objects may not occupy the same space.  This check is sometimes also known as __interference checking__.  Two objects must overlap by at least _overlap_tol_dist_ (see the [opt]*-t* option below) to be considered to overlap.  Overlap testing causes the grid spacing to be refined until the limit is reached, or an overlap is detected. See the [opt]*-g* option below for details on setting the grid spacing. Once overlaps have been detected, grid refinement is not done, and processing stops. 
+
*Volume (v):*	    Computes the volume of the _objects_	    specified on the command line. 
+
*Weight (w):*	    Computes the weight of the _objects_	    specified on the command line. 

*-a*__azimuth_deg__::
*Not Implemented*
+
Sets a rotation (in degrees) of the coordinate system by a given amount about the Z axis. The default is 0.  See also [opt]*-e* . 

*-e*__elevation_deg__::
*Not Implemented*
+
Sets a rotation (in degrees) of the coordinate system by a given elevation from the XY plane (rotation about X axis?). The default is 0. See also [opt]*-a* . 

*-d*::
Enables debugging (off by default). 

*-f*__filename__::
Specifies that density values should be taken from an external file instead of from the *\_DENSITIES* object in the database. This option can be useful when developing the density table with a text editor, prior to importing it to the geometric database. 

*-g*[__initial_grid_spacing__-]__grid_spacing_limit__ or [__initial_grid_spacing__,]__grid_spacing_limit__::
Specifies a limit on how far the grid can be refined and optionally the initial spacing between rays in the grids. The first value (if present) indicates the initial spacing between grid rays.  The mandatory argument, __grid_spacing_limit__, indicates a lower bound on how fine the grid spacing may get before computation is terminated.  In general, the _initial_grid_spacing_ value should be an integer power of the __grid_spacing_limit__.  So for example, if _grid_spacing_limit_ has the value 1, then any _initial_grid_spacing_ specified should be in the sequence 2, 4, 8, 16, 32... so that the grid will refine to precisely the lower limit. The grid spacing may be specified with units.  For example: *5 mm* or *10 in* .  If units are not provided, millimeters are presumed to be the units. 
+
The default values are 50.0 mm and 0.5 mm, which is equivalent to specifying: [opt]*-g 50.0mm-0.5mm* or [opt]*-g 50.0mm,0.5mm* on the command line.  This is a hard limit.  If other analysis constraints are not met, the grid spacing will never be refined smaller than the minimum grid size to satisfy another constraint.  The initial grid spacing is divided in half at each refinement step.  As a result, if you desire a lower limit to actually be tested, then the initial grid size must be a power of 2 greater.  For example, specifying -g10mm,1mm would result in grid spacings of 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25 being used.  If the goal was to exactly end at a 1mm grid, then values such as 8 or 16 should have been chosen for the initial values.  This would result in testing 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 grid spacing values. 

*-G*::
*Not Implemented*
+
Specifies that the program should create new _assembly combinations_ in the geometry database to represent the overlap pairs.  This flag is meaningless if overlap reporting is not turned on with the [opt]*-A* option.  If regions _rod.r_ and _disk.r_	    overlap, this option will cause the creation of an assembly called `\_OVERLAP_rod.r_disk.r`, which includes the following items: 
+

. _rod.r_
. _disk.r_
. _\_OVERLAP_lines_rod.r_disk.r_

+
The last item is an object to represent the overlapping area so that it can be easily seen. The default is that no groups are created. 

*-n*__num_hits__::
Specifies that the grid be refined until each region has at least _num_hits_ ray intersections.  It applies only when weight or volume calculations are being performed.  This limit is not applied per-view, but rather per-analysis. So, for example, it is accepted that a thin object might not be hit at all from one view, but might be hit when it is shot from other views. 
+
The default is 1.  Hence, each region must be intersected by a ray at least once during the analysis. 

*-N*__num_views__::
Specifies that only the first _num_views_	    should be computed.  This is principally a debugging option. 

*-p*__plot_prefix__::
Specifies that [cmd]*gqa* should produce plot files for each of the analyses it performs.  Depending on the analysis type(s) requested, plot files will be named with the specified prefix prepended to one of volume.plot3, gaps.plot3, overlaps.plot3, adj_air.plot3, and/or exp_air.plot3 accordingly. Plot data can be visualized in _mged_ with the _overlay_ command.  Each of the different analysis types write to a separate plot file and use different colors for drawing. 

*-P*__ncpu__::
Specifies that _ncpu_ CPUs should be used for performing the calculation. By default, all local CPUs are utilized. This option exists primarily to reduce the number of computation threads from the machine maximum.  Note that specifying more CPUs than are present on the machine does not increase the number of computation threads. 

*-q*::
Quiets (suppresses) the "was not hit" reporting. 

*-r*::
Indicates that [cmd]*gqa* should print per-region statistics for weight and volume as well as the values for the objects specified on the command line. 

*-S*__samples_per_model_axis__::
Specifies that the grid spacing will be initially refined so that at least _samples_per_axis_min_ will be shot along each axis of the bounding box of the model. For example, if the objects specified have a bounding box of 0 0 0 -> 4 3 2 and the grid spacing is 1.0, specifying the option [opt]*-S 4* will cause the initial grid spacing to be adjusted to 0.5 so that 4 samples will be shot across the Z dimension of the bounding box. The default is to ensure 1 ray per model grid axis. 

*-t*__overlap_tolerance__::
Sets the tolerance for computing overlaps.  The _overlap_tolerance_	    must be a positive number equal to or greater than 0.0.  Any overlap smaller than the value specified will be ignored. The default value is 0.0, which causes any overlap to be reported/processed. The value may be specified with a unit specifier such as: [opt]*-t 1.0mm* or [opt]*-t 0.25in.*

*-U*__use_air__::
Specifies the Boolean value (0 or 1) for _use_air_	    which indicates whether regions which are marked as "air" should be retained and included in the raytrace. *Unlike other BRL-CAD raytracing applications,
the default is to retain air in the raytracing.* The [opt]*-U 0*	    option causes air regions to be discarded prior to raytracing.  If you turn off use_air, and request any analysis that requires it (see [opt]*-A* above), then the program will exit with an error message. 

*-u*__distance_units,volume_units,weight_units__::
Specify the units used when reporting values.  Values must be comma delimited and provided in the order __distance_units__,__volume_units__, __weight_units__.  For example: [opt]*-u "cm,cu ft,kg"*	    or [opt]*-u ,,kg* (The latter example sets only the weight units.) Note that unit values with spaces in their names such as _cu ft_	    must be contained in quotes for the shell to keep the values together. 
+
The default units are millimeters, cubic millimeters, and grams. 

*-v*::
Turns on verbose reporting of computation progress.  This is useful for learning how the computation is progressing, and what tolerances are causing further computation to be necessary. 

*-V*__volume_tolerance[units]__::
Specifies a volumetric tolerance value that the three view computations must be within for computation to complete.  If volume calculation is selected and this option is not set, then the tolerance is set to 1/1,000 of the volume of the model bounding box. For large, complex objects (such as entire vehicles), this value might need to be set larger to achieve reasonable runtimes (or even completion). Given the approximate sampling nature of the algorithm, the three separate view computations will not usually produce identical results. 

*-W*__weight_tolerance[units]__::
This is like the volume tolerance, [opt]*-V*, but is applied to the weight computation results, not the volume computation results. 
+
The weight computation tolerance is probably more appropriate when doing whole-vehicle analysis. If weight computation is selected, it is set to a value equal to the weight of an object 1/100 the size of the model, which is made of the most dense material in the table. 

== EXAMPLES

.Default Behavior
====
The following command computes the weight of an object called _wheel.r_ from the geometry database _model.g_ and reports the weight and volume, and checks for overlaps. 

  gqa model.g wheel.r
====

.Specifying Grid and Target Objects
====
The following will check objects hull, turret, and suspension for overlaps and report exposed air. The grid starts at 1 cm and is refined to 1 mm unless overlaps or exposed air are detected before the grid is refined to 1 mm. 

  gqa -g 1cm-1mm -A oe model.g hull turret suspension
====

.Specifying Using Non-Default Units
====
The following computes volume and weight of hull, turret, and suspension.  Results are reported in cubic centimeters (cc) and ounces (oz).  The grid spacing starts at 5 in. and will not be refined below 0.3 mm spacing. 

  gqa -g5in-0.3mm -Avw -u ft,cc,oz test.g hull turret suspension
====
