== NAME

g-dot - BRL-CAD to DOT language converter

== SYNOPSIS

*g-dot*[-o _output.dot_]_database.g__object(s)_

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*g-dot* converts the specified __object(s)__ from a BRL-CAD __database.g__ file to the __DOT__ language format. The [opt]*-o* option specifies an output .dot file (writes to stdout by default).

The DOT language format is a plain text format for describing graphs. Programs like Graphviz, Tulip, OmniGraffle, and others can render .dot files (such as those produced by [cmd]*g-dot*) as images.
