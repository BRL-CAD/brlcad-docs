.SH "NAME"
coil \- Generate various types of coils, using pipe control points calculated from coil dimensions.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBcoil\fP [\fIoptions\fP]... [\fIname\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBcoil\fP creates a pipe shape within \fIcoil.g\fP or a user supplied
file that implements a coil according to user provided dimensions. If
no dimensions are supplied, defaults are used.
.SH "OPTIONS:"
.sp
\fB\-d outer_diameter\fP
.RS 4
Sets the outer diameter (millimeters) of the
coil.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-w wire_diameter\fP
.RS 4
Specify the diameter (millimeters) of the wire to
be wound into a coil.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-H helix_angle\fP
.RS 4
Specify the helix angle (degrees) of the coil.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-p pitch\fP
.RS 4
Specify the pitch \- distance between center of wire at
beginning and end of a single turn in mm.  Minimum value is equal to
the wire diameter.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-n number_of_turns\fP
.RS 4
Sets the number of turns desired in the coil.
Must be an integer value greater than zero \- fractional turns are not
supported.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-s cap_type\fP
.RS 4
Specify the capping style for the start of the coil.
The default is 0, with no special styling.  1 is a squared off cap, 2
is a cap ground in the plane normal to the vector of the coiling
direction (the x\-y plane), and 3 squares off the coil as well as
grounding it.  Any non\-default cap will result in extra turns being
added to the coil above those specified with \fB\-n\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-e cap_type\fP
.RS 4
Specify the capping style for the end of the coil.
Default and options are the same as for the starting cap.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-S number_of_turns,outer_diameter,wire_diameter,helix_angle,pitch,winding_direction\fP
.RS 4
An advanced option that allows specification of multiple sections,
with settings specified in a comma delimited list as above.  All
settings are required for each section \- multiple sections are defined
in left to right order with the left\-most section being the starting
section at the origin.  Capping styles are supported for multiple
section coils, but the presence of one or more sections specified with
the \fB\-S\fP will cause any supplied parameters other than capping
styles to be ignored.  There is very little sanity checking here \-
many inputs will result in invalid pipe primitives and generate only
an empty database file.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-l length\fP
.RS 4
Clamp the length of a coil to the specified value.  This
option is currently limited \- it will work only for uncapped coils and
the helix angle must be zero.  To fit length, pitch will be adjusted
first.  If pitch adjustments aren\(cqt enough, turns will be removed.  If
both of those variables can\(cqt be adjusted to satisfy the length, wire
diameter will be adjusted.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-L\fP
.RS 4
Instructs the coil tool to create a "left handed" coil (default
is "right handed").  I.e. \- from the starting point of the coil, the
coil winding will proceed in the \-x direction for a left handed coil,
and in the +x direction for a right handed coil.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"

There are many inputs that will be accepted but will attempt to
generate invalid pipes.
