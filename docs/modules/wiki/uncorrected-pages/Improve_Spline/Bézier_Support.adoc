= Improve Spline/Bézier Support
:pp: {plus}{plus}

__' LibreCAD has basic support for
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/B-spline[B-spline] and quadratic splines,
but many interesting features are still missing. For example, methods
for trimming, offsetting, hatching, tangential directions,__etc.'' are
required to allow extensive usage of splines in LibreCAD. A rather
comprehensive collection of spline mathematics can be found at http://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/[A Primer
on Bézier Curves] Examples of spline
features to implement:

* Trimming
* Hatching
* Arc length
* Area enclosed within a contour

== Requirement

* C{pp}, math
