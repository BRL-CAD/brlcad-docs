<h1>Modeling Philosophy</h1>

       Probably one of the difficult parts of geometric modeling is
       where and how to begin the process.  As with most
       procedures, the first step should consist of a review,
       analysis, and planning phase.  Hopefully, some of what has
       been presented up to this point will help in this initial
       phase.  The modeler should think about the task that lies
       ahead, considering such things as the following:  just
       exactly what is the final expected product; what will the
       model be used for; how much descriptive information is
       available, and what form is it in; what, if anything, has
       been done in the past; and can existing ("library")
       components be used.  Next, one should devise a general plan
       on how to accomplish the actual construction of the model,
       including rough time estimates for each phase.  This general
       plan should include all the major subsystems of the target
       that must be modeled.  For most military targets, the
       tersest general plan would consist of the following:  (1)
       model the exterior shell, (2) model the internal air, and
       (3) model all the remaining components.  Of course we are
       being facetious about step (3), but steps (1) and (2) of
       this general plan are genuine.  The goal is to get a
       "correct" exterior shell (with internal air if necessary)
       before any components are added.  If a tank were being
       modeled, the first steps might become as follows:  model the
       hull shell, model the hull air, model the turret shell, and
       model the turret air.

       Finally, since much of the modeling effort goes into step
       (3) (model all remaining components), we will discuss how to
       model components.  This discussion will be more "cookbook"
       oriented, but we still will not go into the details.  Other
       publications <a href="refer.html#Ellis[16]"<b>[16]</b></a>
        have discussed geometric modeling with
       BRL-CAD in detail.  As always, initially, time should be
       spent analyzing and planning.  First analyze the component
       to be modeled and decide on the detail required, formulating
       exactly how to represent the component, including what
       solids to use and how to combine them into regions.  Then
       create the solids, so they have the desired shape, size, and
       orientation.  To take advantage of any symmetry, create the
       solids at the origin.  Next combine the solids into the
       regions, then group these regions into a combination
       representing the completed component.  At this point check
       for and fix any interferences (regions occupying the same
       volume) within the component and create pictures for visual
       verification.  Note that both of these actions are performed
       using ray-tracing.  The model of the component is now
       completed, so it's time to move it to its location within
       the target.  This task is accomplished by editing the
       combination (translate, scale, and/or rotate).  Recall, this
       editing is stored in the matrices of the member records, so
       the components primitives (solid records) are still at the
       origin.  It is recommended to "push" (an MGED command) this
       editing down to the solid records at this time.  Next check
       for and fix any interferences between this component at its
       new location and the rest of the description.  This process
       is repeated for every component that is to be modeled.
