.SH "NAME"
brlman \- a manual page viewer for BRL\-CAD
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBbrlman\fP [\fIoptions\fP]... [\fImanpage\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBbrlman\fP provides manual page viewing capabilities for BRL\-CAD\(cqs
programs, commands, libraries, and conventions (such as file formats
and attribute standards.)  On Unix\-type systems, its default behavior
is to wrap the system \fBman\fP command with the appropriate path
information to allow man to find and display BRL\-CAD\(cqs man pages.  On
systems without a \fBman\fP command, \fBbrlman\fP will instead
launch a Tcl/Tk based graphical view that displays html versions of
the manual pages.  Both versions are generated from the same DocBook
source files and contain the same information.

\fB\-S [1 3 5 n]\fP
.RS 4
Specify a particular section to use when searching
for a man page.  Useful when there are programs and MGED commands with
the same names \- the default man page returned will be that of the
program, so \fB\-S\fP can be used to specify the MGED page instead.
Allowed sections are 1 (programs), 3 (libraries), 5 (conventions), and
n (MGED).
