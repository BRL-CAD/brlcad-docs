== NAME

enf-g - Elysium Neutral Format Translator (ENF to BRL-CAD)

== SYNOPSIS

*enf-g*[-t _tolerance_][-i _starting_ident_number_][-l _name_length_limit_][-n _part_number_to_name_mapping_][-v]_input_enf_facet_file__database.g_

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*enf-g* converts the specified __input_enf_facet_file__ to a BRL-CAD __database.g__ file. This input file is expected to be the ASCII output from the Elysium enf2mxp tessellator. The __tolerance__ provided is the maximum distance (in mm) between two vertices at which they will be considered to be the same vertex. The __starting_ident_number__ is the ident number to use for the first region created, each succeeding region will have their ident numbers incremented by one. If a __name_length_limit__ is provided, then the resulting names in the BRL-CAD model will not be longer than that limit. If a __part_number_to_name_mapping__ file is provided, then that file will be read and used to convert part numbers in the __input_enf_facet_file__ to the corresponding names in the mapping, and is expected to consist of a series of lines of text with each line having a part number and a legal BRL-CAD object name separated by a tab. (__-v__ option is provided for verbose mode.)
