<TITLE>IGES 4.0 to BRL-CAD Translator for CSG Models</TITLE>
<H2>INTRODUCTION</H2>

During the late 1970s, engineers and information scientists saw 
the need to communicate designs, in the form of engineering drawings, 
among the variety of computer-aided drafting (CAD) 
systems coming into widespread use within the engineering community.  
Personnel from Boeing and General Electric collaborated on a scheme 
to make it possible for different CAD systems to exchange data without 
resorting to special programs to translate from one internal database 
to all the other possible formats. <A HREF="ref.html#KELLY[1]"><STRONG>KELLY[1]</STRONG></A>
The scheme was conceptually simple: define a file format that all 
systems could understand (i.e., read and write).  Then when two different 
CAD systems needed to exchange data, the sender would produce the 
neutral data file for the receiver to read.  Out of this early work 
evolved the Initial Graphics Exchange Specification (IGES), which 
was developed by an all-volunteer organization including representatives 
from industry, government, and academia. <A HREF="ref.html#NAGEL[2]"><STRONG>NAGEL[2]</STRONG></A>
The first specification was completed in 1980 and 
became an American National Standards Institute (ANSI) standard
in 1981. <A HREF="ref.html#Y14.26M[3]"><STRONG>Y14.26M[3]</STRONG></A>
The original specification dealt mainly with the representation 
of two-dimensional engineering drawings, but did include some capability 
to exchange three-dimensional curves and surfaces.  As CAD systems 
evolved from purely drafting applications to computer-aided drafting 
and design (CADD) functions, then to today's computer-aided design
(CAD) workstations with solid modeling capabilities, the IGES 
community recognized the need for a mechanism to exchange solid models 
as well as flat drawings.  The IGES 4.0 specification, completed in 
June of 1988, includes capabilities to represent constructive solid 
geometry models. <A HREF="ref.html#SMITH[4]"><STRONG>SMITH[4]</STRONG></A>
This version of IGES became an ANSI standard (ASME Y14.26M-1989) 
in 1989 and is entitled <EM>Digital Representation for Communication 
of Product Definition Data.</EM> <A HREF="ref.html#ASME[5]"><STRONG>ASME[5]</STRONG></A>
ASME Y14.26M-1989 is the current standard and is the basis for the 
work presented in this report.  But the latest version of IGES
(Version 5.1) was released in September of 1991 and will soon begin 
the process toward becoming an ANSI standard.  The major enhancement 
in IGES 5.1 is additional capability in the solid modeling area namely, 
support for boundary representation models. <A HREF="ref.html#REED[6]"><STRONG>REED[6]</STRONG></A>
When this IGES version becomes a standard, the capabilities will 
exist for virtually complete exchange of solid models among unlike 
CAD systems.<P>
