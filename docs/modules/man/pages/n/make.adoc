== NAME

make - Creates a new_shape of the indicated type.

== SYNOPSIS

*[cmd]#make#*  [-t] [[rep]_new_shape type_]

== DESCRIPTION

Creates a _new_shape_ of the indicated type. The _new_shape_ is sized according to the current view size and is dependent on the__type__. The possible values for _type_ are: 

* arb8 -- ARB (eight vertices) 
* arb7 -- ARB (seven vertices). 
* arb 6 -- ARB (six vertices). 
* arb 5 -- ARB (five vertices). 
* arb 4 -- ARB (four vertices). 
* bot -- Bag of Triangles. 
* sph -- Ellipsoid (sphere). 
* ell -- Ellipsoid (ellipsoid of revolution). 
* ellg -- Ellipsoid (general ellipsoid). 
* tor -- Torus. 
* tgc -- Truncated General Cone (most general TGC). 
* tec -- Truncated General Cone (truncated elliptical cone). 
* rec -- Truncated General Cone (right elliptical cylinder). 
* trc -- Truncated General Cone (truncated right circular cone). 
* rcc -- Truncated General Cone (right circular cylinder). 
* half -- Half Space. 
* rpc -- Right Parabolic Cylinder. 
* rhc -- Right Hyperbolic Cylinder. 
* epa -- Elliptical Paraboloid. 
* ehy -- Elliptical Hyperboloid. 
* eto -- Elliptical Torus. 
* part -- Particle. 
* nmg -- Non-Manifold Geometry (an NMG consisting of a single vertex is built). 
* pipe -- Pipe (run of connected pipe or wire). 
* grip -- Support for joints. 
* extrude -- Experimental. 
* sketch -- Experimental. 


== EXAMPLES

The first example shows the use of the *[cmd]#make#*  command to create a sphere with a specified 	name.  The second example shows the use of the *[cmd]#make#*  command with the _-t_ argument to generate a list of shape types handled by *[cmd]#make#* . 

.Create a sphere having a specified name.
====

[prompt]#mged># [ui]`make shapea sph` ::
Creates a sphere named __shapea__. 
====

.Generate a list of shape types handled by *[cmd]#make#* .
====
[prompt]#mged># [ui]`make -t` 

Lists the shape types handled by *[cmd]#make#* .
