*window* [_options_]...

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*window* is a program to create a BRL-CAD database of windows.  Up to twenty-six windows of the same size may be created.  The windows are made with rounded corners. [cmd]*window* uses libwdb to create a BRL-CAD database.  The windows are composed of two arb8s and four cylinders.   This program may be run interactively or the user may specify options on a command line.  If the user chooses to run the program interactively, he answers the questions as the program prompts him.  Below are the options that can be used on the command line.
