.SH "NAME"
pixbustup \- break up concatenated pix images into separate files

\fBpixbustup\fP \fIbasename\fP \fIwidth\fP [\fIimage_offset\fP] [\fIfirst_number\fP] < \fIinput.pix\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBpixbustup\fP takes input consisting of a concatenated collection
of \fBpix\fP(5) format files and breaks them up into
separate files.  The output file names will be of the form
\fIbasename.num\fP, where \fIbasename\fP is given on the command line, and
\fInum\fP is a consecutive series of integers.  By default the first image
will be made number " 0 ", but an alternate \fIfirst_number\fP can be
given. The images must be square and the width (and height) is given
by \fIwidth\fP. The program keeps reading these small files until end of
file is reached. If one does not wish to extract from the beginning of
the input file, an \fIimage_offset\fP can be given which will skip that
number of images before beginning.
.sp
This program is mostly a holdover from the days when
\fBrt\fP(1) wrote animations into one huge file, but
it is still sometimes useful.
