== NAME

STEP - ISO 10303 Standard for the Exchange of Product model data


== BACKGROUND

In 1984, the International Organization for Standardization (ISO)
began working to create a standard to allow for the electronic
exchange of product data between computer-based product life-cycle
systems.  This scope was intentionally much broader than just geometry
information, and the resulting standard (ISO 10303: Industrial
automation systems and integration -- Product data representation and
exchange) is extremely large.  Consequently, the standard is
subdivided into _parts_, which are referred to individually as ISO
10303-xxx where xxx is the part number.  Because of the large scope,
there is a numbering convention used to represent more focused
sub-scopes in order to make locating specific types of information
simpler:

The lowest level parts that define STEP in a practical sense are
http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=38047[ISO
10303-011],
http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=33713[ISO
10303-21], and
http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=25097[
ISO 10303-022].  10303-011 defines the EXPRESS language, which is in
turn the language in which application protocol schemas are written.
10303-21 defines a clear text encoding of the STEP exchange
structure - files using this schema are referred to as "STEP" or "Part
21" files. 10303-022 defines a Standard Data Access Interface (SDAI)
which is used to automatically generate practical computer code from
the EXPRESS schema protocol descriptions.  Collectively, these define
the "container" aspects of the STEP file format and a method to access
the information from the file.  (This is similar to using XML with a
schema file to store information, and newer schemas are also available
in an XML form in addition to EXPRESS.)

A number of
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_STEP_%28ISO_10303%29_parts#AIC_-_Application_interpreted_constructs[other]
low level parts and higher level Application Interpreted Constructs
(AICs) form the foundation on which the more complete "high level"
parts are defined.  This separation is performed mainly to allow
maximal sharing and compatibility between different high level parts
that need the same lower level foundations.

Within that context, the primary components of interest for practical
data import and export are the Application Protocols (AP) that focus
on shape models and assembly structure (among other things.)  The
first such protocol was AP203 - "Configuration-controlled design". As
experience using the standard in real world applications accumulated,
new revisions and new application protocols were developed.  Today,
the following protocols exist:

|Most recent version is 10303-203:1994 with additions and corrections
 as follows: the original document was subsequently revised by one
 amendment https://www.iso.org/standard/34177.html[10303-203:1994/Amd

 ]. https://www.iso.org/standard/39522.html[10303-203:2005] is
 considered a revision to this standard.

|AP203e2
|https://www.iso.org/standard/44305.html[Configuration controlled 3D

|Most recent version is 10303-203:2011.  Revises
 https://www.iso.org/standard/39522.html[10303-203:2005], which is
 listed as a modular version that is harmonized with ISO
 10303-214. https://www.iso.org/standard/57620.html[10303-242:2014] is
 considered a revision to this standard.

|AP214
|https://www.iso.org/standard/43669.html[Core data for automotive

|Most recent version is 10303-214:2010 (a.k.a AP214e3). Two earlier
 versions exist:
 https://www.iso.org/standard/38727.html[10303-214:2003] and
 https://www.iso.org/standard/23643.html[10303-214:2001]. https://www.iso.org/standard/57620.html[10303-242:2014]
 is considered a revision to this standard.

|AP242
|https://www.iso.org/standard/57620.html[Managed model-based 3D
 engineering]
|Most recent version is 10303-242:2014. This standard is intended to
 consolidate and replace AP203e2 and AP214. One correction has been
 published: https://www.iso.org/standard/72059.html[10303-242:2014/Cor
 1:2016].
|===

AP203e2 is sufficiently different from AP203 that practically speaking
it merits being called out as its own distinct protocol, but in the
nomenclature of the ISO standards it is still considered a revision to
AP203.

These protocols are the portion of ISO 10303 that address the problem
domain previously handled by the Initial Graphics Exchange
Specification (xref:man:5/IGES.adoc[*IGES*(5)]).  In a computer aided
design context where transfer of "STEP files" is being discussed,
those files will most likely correspond to one of the previous
protocols.

TODO - Determine what MIM, AIM and AAM are and document them...

== SCHEMAS AND IMPLEMENTATION RESOURCES

To obtain the latest schema files (which, unlike the ISO standards
themselves, are freely available) check the
http://stepmod.sourceforge.net/[STEP Module Repository Project] - in
particular, the
http://stepmod.cvs.sourceforge.net/viewvc/stepmod/stepmod/data/modules/[modules]
directory.

The standards define the structure of the schemas, but in general when
it comes to the nuts and bolts of implementing a practical importer
and exporter more resources are needed.  Below are links to some
implementation resources:
