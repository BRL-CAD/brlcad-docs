<h2><A NAME="Vulnerability/Lethality Assessments">Vulnerability/Lethality Assessments</a></h2>
<p>
The vulnerability of a system is a measure of that system's
susceptibility to damage when attacked by a particular threat
mechanism.  Lethality, on the other hand, considers the reciprocal, and
estimates the damage a threat inflicts on a particular target.  The
earliest attempts at V/L assessments were concerned with tanks being
attacked by direct fire weapons, and relied heavily on subjective
judgement.  The major concern was perforation of the armor; hence, the
only geometric information needed was armor thickness and obliquity
angle.  The penetration capability of the attacking munition was matched
against the armor.  If perforation occurred, then estimates were made
concerning damage and residual system combat capability.  Methodology
soon began to emerge, however, and by the late 1950s, computer codes
existed to estimate damage sustained by armored vehicles attacked by
direct fire munitions. These early V/L analysis computer codes
considered large numbers of shot locations on a target from several
attack aspects.  For each attack azimuth, shot locations were evaluated
for a grid completely covering the target.  The geometric information
required was a formatted file containing a sequential listing of
information about each component encountered for each grid cell (or shot
location). The required information included the name of the component,
line-of-sight thickness, entrance and exit obliquity angles, and the
type of material.  This information, known as shotline data, was
manually derived.  For each attack direction, a 4-inch grid was
physically drawn over the appropriate engineering drawing.  Then, on a
cell-by-cell basis, the shotline data were estimated<p>

<p>
and written in the correct format to be evaluated by the V/L analysis
computer code.
<p>
This shotline generation procedure was unsatisfactory.  The manual
nature and subjectiveness made the whole process error-prone and
time-consuming.  In addition, only those attack views for which
engineering drawings existed could be evaluated.  The attempt to rectify
these shortcomings led directly to the birth of 3-dimensional solid
geometric modeling in the Army.  The process certainly had to be
computerized; hence, the solution to the shotline generation problem was
twofold.  First, a technique of representing the geometry of the target
in the computer was required. Second, an algorithm which would allow the
computer to interrogate the geometric representation stored in its
memory and calculate the shotline data would complete the solution.  In
1967, a contract with the Mathematical Applications Group, Inc. 
<a HREF="refer.html#MAGI[1]"><b>MAGI[1]</b></a> provided the solution.
MAGI introduced the Combinatorial Solid Geometry (CSG) technique for
representing geometry in a computer and the ray-tracing geometry
interrogation scheme.

The CSG approach, still in use today, uses Boolean combinations of
simple solid geometric shapes, or primitives, to model components at any
level of detail. Figure 2. is a rendering of the current set of
primitives while figure 3. shows the results of several Boolean
operations.  The first geometric modeling system using the CSG technique
required three separate files.  The first file contained the parameters
of the individual primitives, defining the shape, size, location, and
orientation of each. The second file defined the regions, which are the
Boolean constructs combining the primitives from the first file. The
third file identified the regions by labeling which component of the
target each region represented.  These CSG files constituted what has
become known as a target description.  The target description was
required input to the ray-tracing code to produce the shotline
information.

<h2><A NAME="Ray-Tracing">Ray-Tracing</a></h2>
<p>
The ray-tracing technique, as its name implies, mathematically
intersects rays, or lines, with the CSG target description.  Parallel
rays are initiated from a "grid plane" oriented at the desired attack
direction. These rays are intersected with the regions of the
description.  As the ray encounters a region, at the intersections with
each of the defining primitives of that region, the 3-dimensional
coordinate locations and surface normals are calculated.  The
primitive-ray intersections are then combined according to the Boolean
formula for that region <p>

<p>
to produce the actual
intersections for that region.  These intersection coordinates are used
to calculate thicknesses, which, along with surface normals and other
information further identifying the region, constitute the shotline
information.
<p>
The ray-tracing code eliminated the shortcomings of the hand-generated
shotline process and greatly increased the overall V/L capability.
Parallel shotline information could now be quickly generated from any
attack direction, including nonzero elevations.  Furthermore, divergent
rays could be used to simulate the bursting phenomenon.  Ray- tracing
continues, to this day, to be a flexible geometry interrogation tool and
has been used to simulate many

       The development of the ray-tracing technique immediately
       turned the spotlight directly on the target description.  In
       addition, new capabilities and more detailed analyses placed
       increased emphasis on the target descriptions.  Soon the
       construction and validation of target descriptions became
       the most crucial and time-consuming element in the V/L
       process.  The demand for highly detailed, accurate, and
       timely target descriptions quickly outdistanced the
       capability to produce them.  The main reason was that the
       construction procedure itself remained a manual process,
       mired in a mainframe/batch computing environment.  With the
       promise demonstrated by the emerging interactive computer
       graphics field and the move towards the open environment of
       the UNIX operating system, a long-term project was initiated
       in late 1970s to address this problem.  The goal of this
       project was to create an interactive CSG geometric modeling
       system within the framework of a more flexible, portable
       computing environment.
<p>
       In 1983, the first interactive CSG modeling system[2] was
       introduced.  This system greatly reduced the time required
       to construct and validate CSG target descriptions.  The
       computer hardware necessary to support this interactive
       modeling system was rather limited, and included a mini-
       computer driving a single display device.  Soon, however,
       the graphics work-station entered the market, providing a
       tremendous boost to the target description preparation
       process.  The work-station provided target describers with a
       powerful, dedicated computing platform, including excellent
       interactive graphics capability, all at a relatively low
       cost.
<p>
       About the same time, the algorithms of the early ray-tracing
       codes were rewritten in the C programming language and put
       in a library.  This library made the development of new
       ray-tracing-based applications codes much easier.  The
       interactive modeling system and a large volume of associated
       software have been bundled into what is known as the BRL-CAD
       <a HREF="refer.html#MUUSS[3]"><b>Muuss[3]</b></a> package.  
	This software has been distributed world-wide
       since 1987 and is continually being expanded and improved.
