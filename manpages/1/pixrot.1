.SH "NAME"
pixrot \- rotate, invert, or reverse a color pix file
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBpixrot\fP [\-#bytes] [\-rifb] [\-s \fIsquaresize\fP] [\-w \fIin_width\fP] [\-n \fIin_height\fP] [\fIfile.pix\fP] > \fInewfile.pix\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBpixrot\fP will rotate, invert, or reverse a color
\fBpix\fP(5) format file or read from standard input
if a file name is not given.  The \fB\-w\fP and \fB\-n\fP flags
specify the input file width and number of scan lines in pixels; they
can be set to the same value via \fB\-s\fP.
.sp
The \fB\-r\fP flag reverses the scan lines left to right. The
\fB\-i\fP flag inverts the image top to bottom. The \fB\-f\fP and
\fB\-b\fP flag will rotate the image ninety degrees forward or
backward respectively. The sense of the rotation is relative to a
first quadrant coordinate system, i.e. origin lower left, where
"forward" means clockwise.
.sp
Note that a 180 degree rotation can be obtained by both reversing and
inverting.
.sp
By default three byte pixels are assumed as in the
\fBpix\fP(5) format.  However, the \fB\-#\fP
\fIbytes\fP flag can be used to specify some other pixel size, where
\fIbytes\fP is the number of bytes per pixel.  Thus this program can be
used to manipulate rectangles of other data types, such as an array of
floating point numbers, files of text, etc.
.SH "METHOD"
.sp
A fairly large buffer is kept in memory so that, file size permitting,
the entire rotation can occur without seeking on input or output. In
any event, the algorithm is designed to process the input
sequentially, so that if any seeking is required, it will happen on
output only.  If these seeks fail, e.g. the output is a pipe, the user
will be told that it needs a file on output. A more general solution
to this problem would be to see if seeks can be done on input instead,
and switch the algorithm to seek on input only.

.SH "BUGS"
.sp
If the file size is very large, excessive seeking may occur on output
and the rotation will take a very long time.  More complicated
algorithms could remedy this. Rotations of arbitrary angle are not
supported.
