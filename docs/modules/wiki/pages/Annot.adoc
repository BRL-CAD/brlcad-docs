Annotations are currently created through the "in" command. Support for
the annotation editor is yet to be provided. This primitive allows users
to label models in the wireframe view. The primitive is aimed to be in
the plane of the screen always, irrespective of the rotations. The annot
object shown has the name annot_test. "get" and "l"(ell) commands give
an overview of the structure. The input format can also be found below.
Note that the second point that is entered by the user is relative to
the first point. (This is done to make it easier, when the editor comes
into place)

 mged> in
 Enter name of solid: annot_test
 Enter solid type: annot
 Enter the point to be annotated: 0
 Enter Y: 0
 Enter Z: 0
 Enter the text label: (0,0,0)
 Enter X,Y for the text placement: 3
 Enter Y: 3
 Enter the relative vertical position(1->bottom, 2->middle, 3->top): 3
 Enter the relative horizontal position(1->right, 2->center, 3->left): 1
 annot_test

Below is the get command

 mged> get annot_test

result:

 annotation
  V {0 0 0}
  VL { {3 3} {0 0} }
  SL { { line S 0 E 1 }
  { label (0,0,0) ref_pt 0 position top right } }

The l command (ell).

....
mged> l annot_test

annot_test:  2D annotations (annotation)
    V = (0 0 0)
    2 vertices
    Vertices:
     0-(3 3) 1-(0 0)

    Ant:
        Line segment (3 3) <-> (0 0)
        Reference point (3 3)
        Relative position: top right

    Label text: (0,0,0)
....

What we currently have is a foundation for the future work. Still, there
are plenty of things to be done that will be accomplished with time.
