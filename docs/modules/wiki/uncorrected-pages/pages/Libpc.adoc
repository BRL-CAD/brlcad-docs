== libpc: Introduction

== Objectives

The objectives encompassed by libpc are the following

* *Front-end*

. An Abstraction of Parameters over the present components of
primitives
. Representation of complex (see examples) constraints between
Parameters
. Framework for selection of Design/Alternative Configurations

* *Back-end*

. Fast Geometric Constraint Solution

=== Advantages

. Reduction of Modeling time in case of Iterative designs
. Logic of Design represented in the geometry file itself
. Capability for complex geometry generation

== Constraint Satisfaction Process

== Possible Approaches in BRL-CAD

== Structure

libpc is composed of the following modules

. Reprsentation of Parameters and Constraints in Storage
. Representation of Parameters in Memory
. Representation of Constraints in Memory / DataStructure
 .. Associated MathGrammar and MathVM
. Generation of 2 and 3 from 1
. Solution System
 .. Constraint Network Generation from 4
 .. Constraint Satisfaction
. Parameter and Geometry updation
