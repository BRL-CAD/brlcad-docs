perl-brlcad is a proposed effort to wrap BRL-CAD functionality with Perl
code (see References).

The project has not been started, but the sister Python project may be
used as a template.

To complete the goal of this GSOC task, at least the following
primitives (already implemented in Python) would need to be done:

ARBN, ARB, EHY, ELL, ELL, EPA, ETO, EXTRUDE, HYP, PIPE, PARTICLE,
REVOLVE, RHC, RPC, SKETCH, TGC, REC, TOR, COMBINATION

Completing any of the remaining primitives would be very desirable:

ARS, BINUNIF, BOT, BREP, CLINE, DSP, EBM, GRIP, HALF, HF, METABALL,
NURB, PG, SUBMODEL, SUPERELL, VOL, PNTS, ANNOTATION, HRT, CONSTRAINT
