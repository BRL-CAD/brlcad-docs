<H1><A NAME="Manging BRL-CAD">Managing BRL-CAD Data Files</a></h1>
<p>
       In the following sections, we will discuss the BRL-CAD data
       file and suggest an approach to managing it.  The data file
       is designed to allow storage of huge volumes of information.
       In the 1970s, target descriptions consisting of 1,000
       objects were considered high detail, yet today there are
       descriptions consisting of tens of thousands of objects.
       Individual components have been treated as a system
       themselves and modeled down to the "wire" level (see Figure
       18).  Descriptions of dozens of separate targets have been
       combined in one file to represent whole military units (see
       Figure 19).  All of these feats owe their success to the
       design and flexibility of the BRL-CAD database.  We will
       look at how the data are stored, the internal file
       structure, and how data are referenced and organized.

       The BRL-CAD data file is a binary UNIX file of sequential
       blocks or records of data.  The actual organization of the
       data in any particular record depends on the type of
       information stored there.  There are only two main types of
       records, the solid record and the combination record.  The
       solid record stores all the parameters necessary to define
       the various primitives.  The combination record is used to
       store all the other nonsolid objects.  Its obvious function
       is to group any number of objects together.  The combination
       record consists of a header record followed immediately by a
       series of member records.  It is important to note that each
       member record in a combination contains a transformation
       matrix.  Any editing is stored in these matrices.  If the
       whole combination is edited, then every member matrix is
       modified to reflect this editing.  Any member of a
       combination may be edited as part of that combination.  In
       this case, only the appropriate member matrix is modified.
       The important fact to remember is that any editing of
       combinations is stored in transformation matrices.  On the
       other hand, any editing of solids results in actual changes
       in the stored parameters.
<p>
       All objects in the BRL-CAD data file are referenced by a
       name.  This name must be unique and may consist of any
       characters on the keyboard.  One must, however, avoid using
       any special characters in a name, especially the /, \, *,
       and !.  Upper and lower case letters are considered
       different characters; thus, Armor and armor are different
       names.  Names such as plate#23(t=2.5) and wire_1w235 are
       perfectly legal names.  As expected, names are usually
       selected to identify the object as to its function, and the
       whole process has become quite individualized.  We will
       discuss more about names in a later section.

<h2><a NAME="Creating Hierarchies">Creating Hierarchies</a></h2><p>
       The BRL-CAD data file is naturally organized in a
       hierarchical nature (see Figure 20).  From the discussion
       earlier about data records, one can see that every object in
       the data file is either a member of some combination or by
       definition, a top-level object.  Hence, just by creating
       combinations, one is creating a hierarchy of objects.  The
       primitives (solid records) are created first since under the
       CSG scheme they are the building blocks.  The primitives are
       then combined into regions (combinations).  The regions are
       next grouped together, usually to represent a component of
       the target.  Next, several components are combined to
       represent a subsystem of the target.  As these natural,
       logical groupings are accomplished, the hierarchical
       structure of the target emerges.  This grouping process
       continues until one combination, the top-level object,
       represents the complete target.  This hierarchy has been
       constructed from the bottom, where all the solids were
       defined, to the peak, where the top-level object reigns.
       This hierarchy is evaluated opposite of the way it was
       constructed, i.e., from the top, down.

<h2><a name="Some Conventions">Some Conventions</a></h2><p>
       As the modeling of a target progresses and the hierarchical
       structure takes shape, the user has the freedom to select
       names on a personal preference basis.  However, it is
       beneficial to other users of the data if some conventions or
       standard practices are observed in the selection of the
       names.  The following scheme is presently in use at the BVLD
       for the construction of BRL-CAD models of armored vehicles.
       This scheme can be used as a guide in selecting similar
       naming conventions for other classes of targets.  The naming
       conventions for armored vehicles are concerned only with the
       top few levels of the hierarchy.  The modeler is free to be
       creative at the lower levels.
<p>
       As previously discussed in detail, BRL-CAD target
       descriptions are utilized in several V/L applications.  It
       is only logical, therefore, that the top-level name[s]
       should indicate the intended usage.  Upon seeing the top-
       level object name, any user would then know the intended
       application and, therefore, how the target was modeled.
       Note that the "tops" command in MGED (the BRL-CAD geometry
       editing code) will list all top-level objects in a BRL-CAD
       file.  As we have seen, components are modeled differently
       depending on the intended application, and this difference
       is often in the amount of detail.  The hierarchical nature
       of the data file allows one to create several versions of a
       single component while sharing common geometry.  Extending
       this feature allows several versions of the same target to
       coexist in the database, sharing common elements.  With this
       in mind, each top-level name has two characters assigned
       which are used to distinguish lower-level names.  In the
       armored vehicle naming scheme, the following top-level names
       have been selected (the assigned two characters are in
       parentheses):  nuclear (nu), compartment (ca), component
       (co), sparc (sp), radar (ra), and infrared (ir).  As new
       applications arise, a similar top-level name and associated
       two-character designator will be chosen.
<p>
       At the next level immediately below the top level, which we
       will call the (-1) level, we have selected three names:
       turret.nn, hull.nn, and suspension.nn.  The "nn" suffixes
       represent the two characters assigned to the top-level
       names.  At the next level below each of these names, the (-
       2) level, we have selected three names for the hull.nn and
       turret.nn groups.  No further names have been selected for
       the suspension.nn group.  For the turret.nn group, the
       following names have been selected:  tur.ext.nn, tur.int.nn,
       and tur.air.nn.  As no surprise, the following names have
       been selected for the hull.nn group:  hull.ext.nn,
       hull.int.nn, and hull.air.nn.  These lower-level naming
       conventions for armored vehicles are summarized in Table 1.
