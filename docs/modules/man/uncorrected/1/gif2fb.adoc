== NAME

gif2fb - display GIF file on frame buffer

== SYNOPSIS

*gif2fb* [-H] [-v] [-F _frame_buffer_name_] _GIF_file_name_

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*gif2fb* displays on a frame buffer the images described by a CompuServe GIF (Graphics Interchange Format) file. The [opt]*-F* option outputs to the specified frame buffer instead of the one specified by the __FB_FILE__ environment variable (or the default frame buffer, if __FB_FILE__ is not set). The frame buffer size requested will be the same as the input GIF screen size. The actual size obtained depends on details of the specific frame buffer. The [opt]*-H* option prints the GIF screen size on stderr. The [opt]*-v* option prints additional information about the GIF file on stderr. The __GIF_file_name__ specifies the GIF input file to be translated, rather than reading the file from the standard input.
