.SH "NAME"
rtscale \- supplements rthide output by plotting a scale to indicate drawing size in arbitrary units.

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBrtscale\fP supplements the use of \fIrthide\fP by generating a
UNIX\-Plot of a scale that permits the accurate measuring of \fIrthide\fP
plots. \fIrthide\fP provides a hidden\-line\-removed plot of the geometry,
and \fBrtscale\fP produces an identical plot file containing just a
scale.  The two files can then be concatenated making sure that the
scale precedes the \fIrthide\fP file to produce a finished plot with
scale.
.sp
\fBRtscale\fP operates on the RT log file from the \fIrthide\fP run and
produces a UNIX\-Plot file of a scale with desired units and number of
tick marks.  The scale\(cqs width is given in model units.  A descriptive
string may be added.  The scale and the strings are plotted in the
lower left corner of the image.
.sp
The inputs required are: \fIwidth,\fP which specifies the length of the
scale in model space, \fIunits,\fP which may be any units (metric or
English), \fIintervals,\fP which allows the user to specifies the number
of tickmarks on the scale. \fIfilename,\fP which names the RT log file
that is used to calculate the view2model matrix for the raytraced. A
view such as azimuth 45, elevation 45, is useful for measuring
diagonal dimensions of the geometry. Optionally, a \fIdescriptive
string\fP may be given to identify the view or the model.
.SH "EXAMPLE"
.sp
This section shows the ordinary usage of \fBrtscale\fP.  For example:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
rtscale 30 mm 10 rt.log > scale.plot3
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
This will result in a 30 mm scale with ten tickmarks being plotted in
the lower left corner of the scale.plot3 image.  Alternately, a
descriptive string may be given to identify the view or the model:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
rtscale 30 mm 10 rt.log "UH\-60 a90 e0" > scale.plot3
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
Note that a descriptive string longer than 28 characters will be cut
off by \fIplot3\-fb\fP.
.sp
The plot file is now concatenated with the plot file of the image to
scale needs to be put on.  The order in which they are concatenated is
important: the scale is always concatenated over top of the model
plot:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
cat scale.plot3 model.plot3 >> model.w.scale.plot3
.fi
.if n .RE
.sp
The resulting UNIX\-Plot of the geometry with a scale added to it can
be viewed in several ways.  It can be overlaid in \fImged\fP, or it can be
rotated to the desired azimuth and elevation with \fIplot3rot\fP and be
stored in a file or view with \fIplot3\-fb\fP:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
plot3rot \-a# \-e# \-g model.w.scale.plot3 | plot3\-fb
.fi
.if n .RE

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.sp
Numerous error conditions are possible, usually due to errors in the
geometry database. Descriptive messages are printed on standard error
(file descriptor 2).
