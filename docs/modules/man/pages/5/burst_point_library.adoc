== NAME

burst_point_library - Data output by the burst-file command from the
burst tool.


== FORMAT

Burst point library files are composed of single-line records. Each
line begins with a digit that identifies the type of record it
represents. The file is composed of one or more runs that begin with a
run header. Each shotline that intersects the target will result in a
shotline header that is followed by one or more shotline intersection
records. If a burst point occurs along a shotline, the burst ray
header will immediately follow that shotline's last intersection
record. Each burst ray header records will be immediately followed by
burst ray intersection records, one for each ray that strikes a
critical component.
