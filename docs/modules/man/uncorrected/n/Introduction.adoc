This is BRL-CAD's tool for viewing manual pages for commands. To bring up the manual page for a specific command select it from the list to the left of this welcome message. 

By default, the list will itemize GED commands if the man viewer is launched from MGED or Archer, and command line commands if the brlman program is run directly from the command line.  To specify a specific section of manual pages to list with brlman, use the -S option on the command line to specify 1, 3, 5 or n (with n being GED commands.) 

These manual pages are written in Docbook format and displayed as HTML.
