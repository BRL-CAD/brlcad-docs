== NAME

asc-nmg - ascii-to-NMG converter

== SYNOPSIS

*asc-nmg* _ascii_file_ _nmg.g_

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*asc-nmg* converts the specified _ascii_file_ (not a .asc
geometry database) to a binary BRL-CAD _nmg.g_ geometry database
file containing NMG objects. The _ascii_file_ is expected to contain
lines of the following forms:

To start a new outer loop for a face:

....

	l
....

To start a new "hole" loop in the current face:

....

	l hole
....

To indicate a vertex in the current loop:

....

	v# x y z
....

where # is the vertex number and x, y, and z are the coordinates of
that vertex.

To extrude a face:

....

	e x y z
....

where x, y, and z compose the extrusion vector for the face.

If an extrusion vector is specified, then the first face in the NMG
objects list of faces will be extruded. This is intended for cases
where only one face is described and then extruded to form a
solid. Supplying an extrusion vector when more than one face is
described may produce erroneous results. A solid may be built by
extruding a face or by building enough faces to produce a closed
shell. Each execution of [cmd]*asc-nmg* will produce a single NMG
object.

== EXAMPLE

If the file _ascii_file_ contains the following:

....
l
	e	-1 0 0
	v0	1 -1 -1
	v1	1 1 -1
	v2	1 1 0
	v3	1 0 0
	v4	1 0 1
	v5	1 -1 1
....

the command:

....
$ asc-nmg ascii_file sample.g
....

will produce an 'L'-shaped NMG solid to the _sample.g_ database file.

== DIAGNOSTICS

Error messages are intended to be self-explanatory.
