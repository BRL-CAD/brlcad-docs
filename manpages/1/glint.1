.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBglint\fP [\fIoptions\fP] \fImodel.g\fP \fIobjects\fP...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBglint\fP uses \fBlibrt\fP(3) to fire an array
of parallel rays at the specified \fIobjects\fP in the database
\fImodel.g\fP and reports overlaps, vacuums, and potential problems with
air regions. By default, the output consists of single\-line reports,
each of which contains a tag identifying the report type and then
other data as appropriate for that type report. Unless the \fB\-p\fP
option is specified, the exact formats are:
.sp
overlap r1 r2 length x_in y_in z_in x_out y_out z_out
.RS 4
Consecutive
partitions overlap by more than \fItol\fP (see the \fB\-t\fP option). The
data reported are the names of the two regions involved, the length of
the overlap along the ray, and the model coordinates of the ray\(cqs
entry into and exit from the overlap.
.RE
.sp
air_contiguous r1 a1 r2 a2 x y z
.RS 4
Consecutive partitions have unlike
(nonzero) air codes and the space between them is less than \fItol\fP (see
the \fB\-t\fP option). The data reported are the names and air codes
of the two regions involved and the model coordinates of the point of
contiguity.
.RE
.sp
air_unconfined r1 (s1) r2 (s2) length x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2
.RS 4
A partition
with nonzero air code follows or precedes another partition and the
space between them is more than \fItol\fP (see the \fB\-t\fP option). The
data reported are the names of the two regions (and solids) involved,
the length of the gap along the ray, and the model coordinates of the
ray\(cqs exiting the first partition and entering the second.
.RE
.sp
air_first r a x y z
.RS 4
The first partition has a nonzero air code. The
data reported are the name and air code of the region involved and the
model coordinates of the ray\(cqs entering the partition.
.RE
.sp
air_last r a x y z
.RS 4
The last partition has a nonzero air code. The
data reported are the name and air code of the region involved and the
model coordinates of the ray\(cqs exiting the partition.
.RE
.sp
vacuum r1 (s1) r2 (s2) length x1 y1 z1 x2 y2 z2
.RS 4
The space between
consecutive partitions is more than \fItol\fP (see the \fB\-t\fP
option). The data reported are the names of the two regions (and
solids) involved, the length of the gap along the ray, and the model
coordinates of the ray\(cqs exiting the first partition and entering the
second.
.RE
.SS "Command\-line options"
.sp
\fB\-a\fP \fIaz\fP
.RS 4
Sets the azimuth from which to fire rays to \fIaz\fP
degrees. The default is 0.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-c\fP
.RS 4
Specifies that one ray should be fired from the center of each
grid cell. By default, \fBglint\fP fires a ray from one random point
in each cell.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-e\fP \fIel\fP
.RS 4
Sets the elevation from which to fire rays to \fIel\fP
degrees. The default is 0.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-g\fP \fIgridsize\fP
.RS 4
Sets the width and height of each grid cell to \fIgridsize\fP millimeters. The default is 100 mm.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-o\fP
.RS 4
Causes \fBglint\fP to include in each report the model
coordinates of the ray origination point. These appear between the tag
and the rest of the data.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-p\fP
.RS 4
Causes \fBglint\fP to produce its reports as \fIplot3(5)\fP
drawing commands instead of ASCII text. This is useful in conjunction
with the "overlay" command of \fImged\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-r\fP \fIbits\fP
.RS 4
Specifies which types of reports to produce. If, after
an optional minus sign, \fIbits\fP begins with either "0x" or "0X", the
remainder is interpreted in hexadecimal. Otherwise, if \fIbits\fP begins
with "0", the remainder is interpreted in octal. Otherwise, \fIbits\fP is
interpreted in decimal. The meaning of the individual bits is as
follows: 1 overlaps 2 contiguous unlike airs 4 unconfined airs 8 air
first on rays 16 air last on rays 32 vacuums. If there was no initial
minus sign, then \fIbits\fP specifies which report types to produce. The
minus sign implies complementation: when it is present, \fIbits\fP
specifies which report types \fInot\fP to produce. The default is 1.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-s\fP
.RS 4
Causes \fBglint\fP to collect all the overlap reports and
sort them before printing them. The reports for a given pair of
regions are printed contiguously, and the clusters of reports for the
various pairs of regions appear in order of decreasing cumulative
overlap length. By default, \fBglint\fP reports overlaps immediately
and in the order of their discovery.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-t\fP \fItol\fP
.RS 4
Sets the tolerance for overlaps, contiguous and
unconfined airs, and vacuums to \fItol\fP millimeters. The default is 0.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-u\fP
.RS 4
Sets the \fIuseair\fP member of the \fIrt_i\fP structure to 1, which
causes \fIlibrt\fP to report partitions containing air. It is also set
implicitly if any air\-related reports have been specified. By default,
\fIlibrt\fP ignores air regions.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-x\fP \fIbits\fP
.RS 4
Sets the \fBglint\fP debug flags to \fIbits\fP. See the
\fB\-r\fP option for more details. Note that some of the report types
have no corresponding diagnostics.
