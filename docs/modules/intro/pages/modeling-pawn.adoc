= Modeling Pawn

Let’s begin by creating a new database for your pawn and name it
[path]`pawn.g`. As discussed earlier, to create a new database type the
following command in the _Command Window_:

`[in]#opendb pawn.g#` kbd:[ENTER]

== Creating a cylinder for the base

Begin by making the _Command Window_ active (usually by clicking
anywhere in the window). To make the right circular cylinder, type the
following command in the MGED prompt:

`[in]#in base.rcc rcc#` kbd:[ENTER]

Here, `in` is the command which is used to _**IN**sert a primitive
shape_, `base.rcc` is the name of the shape and `rcc` means it is a
_**R**ight **C**ircular **C**ylinder_.

MGED asks you to enter [rep]*x*, [rep]*y* and [rep]*z* values of the
vertex (where you want to place the center of the bottom of the
shape). Type:

`[in]#0 0 0#` kbd:[ENTER]

Make sure to add spaces between the values.

Next, MGED will ask you to enter the [rep]*x*, [rep]*y* and [rep]*z*
values of the height (H) vector (the height of your cylinder). Type:

`[in]#0 0 0.6#` kbd:[ENTER]

Then, the last value MGED will ask you to enter is the radius. Type:

`[in]#2.25#` kbd:[ENTER]

Your MGED _Command Window_ will look something like:

[subs="+quotes"]
....
[prompt]#mged># [in]#in base.rcc rc#
[prompt]#Enter X, Y, Z of vertex:# [in]#0 0 0#
[prompt]#Enter X, Y, Z of height (H) vector:# [in]#0 0 0.6#
[prompt]#Enter radius:# [in]#2.25#
Base.rcc
....

You will get something like this on your _Graphics Window_:

image::11-base.jpg[]

Rather than following this lengthy method, there is another short way
to use the [cmd]`in` command. It allows entering all the parameters in
one go. The above command can also be written as:

`[in]#in base.rcc rcc 0 0 0 0 0 0.6 2.25#` kbd:[ENTER]

Meaning of the above command is:

* `in` -- Insert a primitive shape
* `base.rcc` -- Name it base.rcc
* `rcc` -- Shape should be a right circular cylinder
* `0` -- x value of the vertex is 0
* `0` -- y value of the vertex is 0
* `0` -- z value of the vertex is 0
* `0` -- x value of the height vector is 0
* `0` -- y value of the height vector is 0
* `0.6` -- z value of the height vector is 0.6
* `2.25` -- radius is 2.25

This is how you will be making the rest of the shapes.

Moving on to the upper portion of the pawn.

== Making the curve

This portion is a little tricky. To make the curve, you will first
make a _Truncated Right Cone_ (trc) and then subtract a _Torus_ (tor)
from the outer portion of trc.

[cols="2*.>~a"]
|===
|
.trc
image::12-trc.jpg[]
|
.tor
image::13-tor.jpg[]
|===

To make the trc, type:

`[in]#in body.trc trc#` kbd:[ENTER]

The *trc* should start from the top of the *rcc* i.e., at the height
of `0.6`.  MGED will ask for the [rep]*x*, [rep]*y*, [rep]*z* values
of the vertex (center of the bottom part). Type:

`[in]#0 0 0.6#` kbd:[ENTER]

Then MGED will ask us to enter [rep]*x*, [rep]*y*, [rep]*z* values of
height vector. Type:

`[in]#0 0 1.7#` kbd:[ENTER]

The next entry we have to make is the radius of the base which must
be the same as the radius of the `base.rcc`. Therefore, type:

`[in]#2.25#` kbd:[ENTER]

The last value MGED asks for is the top radius. Type:

`[in]#0.5#` kbd:[ENTER]

The graphics window will look like:

image::14-base-and-body.jpg[]

To make the curve use the short-hand method of using the [cmd]`in`
command. Type in the _Command Window_:

`[in]#in curve.tor tor 0 0 2.8 0 0 1 2.85 2.35#` kbd:[ENTER]

Here,

* [in]`0 0 2.8` are the [rep]*x*, [rep]*y*, [rep]*z* values of the
  vertex, where:
+
[subs="+quotes"]
....
*2.8* = *0.6* (_z_ value of vertex of _body.trc_)
    + *1.7* (_height_ of _body.trc_)
    + *0.5* (_radius_ of the top of _body.trc_)
....
* [in]`0 0 1` are the [rep]*x*, [rep]*y*, [rep]*z* values of the
  normal vector to make the tube perpendicular to the **z**-axis.
* [in]`2.85` is radius1 (radius from Vertex to the center of the
  tube).
* [in]`2.35` is radius2 (radius of the tube).

The following image visually explains radius1 and radius2.

== Making a cylinder for the neck

The cylinder should have vertex `0 0 2.3` where `2.3` came after
adding vertex and height of `body.trc` such that the neck is placed
right on top of the body. The height vector of the cylinder should be
`0 0 0.5` and the radius should be `1.4`. Therefore, type:

`[in]#in neck.rcc rcc 0 0 2.3 0 0 0.5 1.4#` kbd:[ENTER]


== Making a sphere for the head

Make a sphere with vertex `0 0 3.6` and radius `1.1`. Technically the
vertex of the sphere should be

[subs="+quotes"]
....
*3.6* = *2.3*  (the vertex of _neck.rcc_)
    + *0.25* (half of the height of _neck.rcc_)
    + *1.1*  (radius of this sphere)
....

But we want to cut some portion of the head from below. Type:

`[in]#in head.sph sph 0 0 3.6 1.1#` kbd:[ENTER]

To zoom out of the view click the left mouse button and to zoom back
in click the right mouse button. This is what your pawn looks like
till now:

image::16-pawn-azel-view.jpg[]

Go to *View* from menu bar and click on *Front*. This is what your
pawn looks in the front view:

image::17-pawn-front-view.jpg[]


== Making a region

Before you can raytrace your design, you have to make of region of
all the shapes. Making a region basically means that the shape has
uniform material properties i.e., it has mass and occupies space.
Constructing a region involves using Boolean operations of union,
subtraction, and intersection. To make the region, type:

`[in]#r pawn.r u base.rcc u body.trc - curve.tor u neck.rcc u head.sph#` kbd:[ENTER]

This command tells MGED that

* `*#r#*` -- Make a region
* `*#pawn.r#*` -- Name it pawn.r
* `*#u#*` -- Add the volume of the shape
* `*#-#*` -- Subtract the volume of the shape

Here, we are adding the volume of all the shapes except `curve.tor`,
which we are subtracting from `body.trc` to achieve the required look.

== Assigning Material Properties to the Region

Now type the following in the MGED command window:

`[in]#mater pawn.r#`

MGED will respond with:

....
Current shader string =
Specify shader. Enclose spaces within quotes.
Shader?
....

MGED asks us to enter the type of material we want our region to be
made of. To make the region of plastic. Type in:

`[in]#plastic#` kbd:[ENTER]

Next, MGED will ask for the color. To make our pawn black in color,
type:

`[in]#0 0 0#` kbd:[ENTER]

At last MGED will ask us if we want to inherit the material properties.
To answer with NO, type:

`[in]#0#` kbd:[ENTER]


== Clearing the _Graphic Window_ and drawing the new region

We have shapes visible on our graphics window but it is not our
region. To clear the graphics Window of the old design and draw the
new region, type:

`[in]#B pawn.r#` kbd:[ENTER]

image::18-clear-and-draw-region.jpg[]

You will see your pawn and the curve.tor is dotted which indicates
that it subtracted from the region. This command tells MGED to _Blast_
i.e., clear the graphics window and draw the specified region which in
our case is `pawn.r`. The _Blast_ command is a combination of
[cmd]`Z` and [cmd]`draw` commands. On a side note, [cmd]`draw` command
is used to draw an existing shape. For example, to draw the sphere you
made for the head, type : `[in]#draw head.sph#` which tells MGED to
draw `head.sph`. If the specified shape does not exist, MGED will give
an error.


== Raytracing your model

Go to the *File* menu and select *Raytrace*. A dialog box called the
_Raytrace Control Panel_ appears. Next, change the background color by
the raytraced by selecting [label]#Background Color#. A dropdown will
appear with some predefined color choices and a color tool. Select the
white option. To eliminate the wireframing i.e., the outlines of the
shapes, go to *Framebuffer* (in the _Raytrace Control Panel_) and
select *Overlay*. The display should appear similar to the following
illustration:

Your pawn is ready to serve the King. Now it’s time to model the rest
of the pieces.
