= BRL-CAD Primitives
:toc: left

This article provides an overview of various types of geometric
primitive objects that can be added to a BRL-CAD geometry file. The
shape, size, location and orientation of each such object are defined
by a set of parameters/properties that are specific to its type, which
are discussed in the corresponding section below.

== Arbitrary convex polyhedra

An *arbitrary convex polyhedron* (*arb*) is a geometric volume that is
completely enclosed by a set of 3-dimensional planes. Each has a set
of straight-edged, flat *faces* outlined by the intersections of those
planes. The intersection of each pair of planes is a line whose
intersections with other planes defines a pair of *vertices*. The line
segment between those two vertices is an *edge* of the polyhedron that
is shared by two faces. Each vertex is common to an equal number (at
least three) of faces and edges.

For example, a rectangular parallelepiped is enclosed by three
orthogonal pairs of parallel planes. Their intersections define six
faces, each with four edges and four vertices. There are a total of 12
edges (each shared by two faces) and 8 vertices (each shared by three
faces and three edges).

The BRL-CAD geometry file format defines two types of records for such
polyhedra:

* <<ARB8_Records,**arb8**s>> are specified by a set of eight vertices.
* <<ARBN_Records,**arbn**s>> are specified by a set of intersecting
planes, each defined by four coefficients.

Although any polyhedron can be defined and stored as an arbn, the arb8
record type is more commonly employed because it is simpler to work
with and still accommodates most constructive solid geometry
applications.

[[ARB8_Records]]
=== ARB8 Records

An *arb8* record is specified by a set of eight {X, Y, Z} vertices
designated V1 through V8, which need not all be unique. BRL-CAD uses
such records to represent polyhedra having four, five or six faces:

* *arb8* shapes have eight unique vertices. They represent hexahedra
that have six quadrilateral faces sharing eight edges.  In addition to
simply specifying the {X, Y, Z} coordinates of those vertices, MGED
provides easier ways to create the following specific types of
hexahedra:
 ** *3ptarb* shapes represent *right quadrilateral prisms*, which are
extruded quadrilaterals having parallel ends connected by four
rectangular sides.
 ** *box* shapes represent *parallelepipeds*, whose faces comprise
three pairs of equal parallelograms. Unlike a common box, those faces
need not be rectangular--if they are, the enclosed volume is a
rectangular parallelepiped.
 ** *rpp* shapes represent *rectangular parallelepipeds* (also known
as *cuboids* and *rectangular prisms*), whose faces comprise three
pairs of equal rectangles. If one pair of faces are squares, the
volume is a *square prism*. If all of them are squares, the volume is
a *cube* (geometrically, there cannot be just two pairs of square
faces).

* *arb7* shapes have seven unique vertices. They represent hexahedra
that have four quadrilateral and two triangular faces sharing eleven
edges. They can only be created by specifying the {X, Y, Z}
coordinates of those vertices.

* *arb6* shapes have six unique vertices. They represent triangular
*prisms* and *truncated tetrahedra*, which are pentahedra* that have
two triangular ends connected by three quadrilateral sides sharing
nine edges. In addition to simply specifying the {X, Y, Z} coordinates
of their vertices, MGED provides an easier way to create one specific
type of hexahedron:
 ** *raw* (*right angle wedge*) shapes are *triangular prisms* whose
ends are parallel to each other. Interestingly enough, they don't seem
to require any right angles. If the ends are perpendicular to the
connecting edges, the shape is a *right triangular prism* and has
rectangular sides. Presumably two of the rectangular sides of an
actual right-angle wedge would also be perpendicular to each other.

* *arb5* shapes have five unique vertices. They represent
*quadrahedra*, which are pentahedra that have a quadrilateral base and
four triangular sides sharing eight edges. If such a volume has a
rectangular base it is a *rectangular pyramid*, one with a square base
is a *square pyramid*.

* *arb4* shapes have four unique vertices. They represent
*tetrahedra*, which have four triangular faces sharing six edges.  If
all four triangles are equilateral, the shape is a *regular
tetrahedron*.

[[ARBN_Records]]
=== ARBN Records

An *arbn* record is specified by N sets of intersecting planes, each
defined by four coefficients:

* the {X, Y, Z} coefficients of the plane's normal vector pointing
outward from the center of the arbn shape, and
* the perpendicular distance of that plane from the origin.

As discussed in the
xref:wiki:Creating_and_editing_arbn_primitives.adoc[] article, BRL-CAD
uses such primitives to represent polyhedra having any number of
sides, edges and vertices.

The extruded bitmap (also referred to as EBM) is a solid based on a
greyscale bitmap. The bitmap is an array of unsigned char values, see
bw(5), and is extruded by some distance. The EBM solid requires the
dimensions of the bitmap file (height and width in bytes), an
extrusion length, and a transformation matrix to position
the EBM. Each byte in the bitmap file is treated as the base of a cell
that is extruded by the specified extrusion length. If the value of
the byte is nonÂ­zero, then that cell is considered solid.

=== ars

Arbitrary rectangular solid

Handled by:: in make create

Solids of type 'ars' (Arbitrary Faceted Solids) are defined using
"waterlines". The following figure consists of a start point, some
number of intermediate polygons, and an ending point. Each of the
intermediate polygons have the same number of vertices and the
vertices are numbered 1 thru N. In addition to the intermediate
polygons a line will be created that begins at the start point, goes
through each polygon at its vertex numbered 1, and terminates at the
end point. This is repeated for each polygon vertex 2 thru N. The
start point, polygons, and end point are each a "waterline".

*#need an image here to illustrate the concept#*

the ars shape takes the following values as input:

* The number of points per waterline (the number of vertices on each
  intermediate polygon)
* The number of waterlines (the number of intermediate polygons plus
  2)
* X, Y, and Z for a starting point (the first waterline)
* for each interior polygon (an intermediate waterline)
** for each point on the polygon
*** X, Y, and Z for the point on the polygon
* X, Y, and Z for an ending point (the last waterline)

For example, the command:

....
in x.1 ars 4 6 0 0 3 1 1 3 1 -1 3 -1 -1 3 -1 1 3 1 1 1 1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 1 1 1 0 -1 0 -1 -1 -1 0 -1 0 1 -1 1 0 -3 0 -1 -3 -1 0 -3 0 1 -3 0 0 -3
....

Will produce a square bar with a tapered 1/8 turn twist in the
middle. Of course, more waterlines in the twist and more points per
waterline would make the twist smoother.

.Example ARS
image::Example_ars.png[]

The parameters to the above ars command can be dissected as:

4 :: number of points per waterline (i.e. intermediate polygons have 4
vertices)
6 :: number of waterlines (four intermediate polygons plus the two
endpoints)
0 0 3 :: the center of the top end of the bar
1 1 3 1 -1 3 -1 -1 3 -1 1 3 :: a 2x2 square in the xy plane at z
offset
3 1 1 1 1 -1 1 -1 -1 1 -1 1 1 :: a 2x2 square oriented the same as the
first but at z offset
1 1 0 -1 0 -1 -1 -1 0 -1 0 1 -1 :: a 2x2 square at a 45 degree
rotation from the first squares at z offset
-1 1 0 -3 0 -1 -3 -1 0 -3 0 1 -3 :: a 2x2 square at a 45 degree
 rotation from the first squares at z offset
-3 0 0 -3 :: the center of the bottom end of the bar

low thresholds. Any value in the file that is between the thresholds
(inclusive) represents a solid cell.
