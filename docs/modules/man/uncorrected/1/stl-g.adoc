== NAME

stl-g - Stereolithography Translator (STL to BRL-CAD)

== SYNOPSIS

*stl-g*[-db][-i _initial_ident_][-I _constant_ident_][-m _material_code_][-N _forced_name_][-c _units_][-t _tolerance_][-x _RT_DEBUG_FLAG_]_file.stl__file.g_

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*stl-g* converts the specified __file.stl__ to a BRL-CAD __file.g__ file. Use the [opt]*-b* option if you have a binary STL file (the default is ASCII). The [opt]*-d* option prints debugging information. The [opt]*-c* option specifies the units that are used in the STL file. The __units__ string may be "mm", "in", "ft", ... (default is "mm"). The [opt]*-t* option specifies a tolerance distance (in mm) such that any two vertices within tolerance distance of each other are treated as the same vertex. The [opt]*-i* option sets the starting ident number for the regions created. As each new region is created, this number will be incremented before assigning the next ident number (conflicts with [opt]*-I* ). The [opt]*-I* option sets a constant ident number that will be assigned to all the regions created (conflicts with [opt]*-i* ). The [opt]*-m* option sets a material code that will be assigned to all the regions created (default is 1). The [opt]*-N* option sets a name for the resulting BRL-CAD object. STL files typically do not contain any object names. The [opt]*-x* option sets an RT debug flag (see raytrace.h). The __file.stl__ file is expected to be a stereolithography file.
