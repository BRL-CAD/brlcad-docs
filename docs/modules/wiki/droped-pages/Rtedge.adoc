The rtedge command will render a hidden-line image of the specified
geometry database model. This hidden line image is a raster image that
is similar to what is desired for drafting documentation where the model
is drawn as a series of contour edges. The rtedge command is available
both on the command-line and as an link:mged[mged] command.
