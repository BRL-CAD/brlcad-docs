.SH "NAME"
dbupgrade \- a program to upgrade BRL\-CAD mged geometry databases files to the current version.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBdbupgrade\fP \fIinput.g\fP \fIoutput.g\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBdbupgrade\fP operates on the indicated input geometry database
\fIinput.g\fP, recognizing the version of the BRL\-CAD database provided as
input and then converting it to the current database version.  Output
is then saved to the specified \fIoutput.g\fP file.
.sp
Note that this tool will attempt to automatically \(aqfix\(aq an existing
(v4 format) binary database that was transferred from a
binary\-incompatible platform.  However, this process may be
imperfect \- the best approach (if the original platform on which the
file was created is available) is to run \fBdbupgrade\fP on the file
before transferring from the originating platform.  Once upgraded the
output file will be platform\-independent regardless of the platform on
which the upgrade was done.
.sp
Running \fBdbupgrade\fP removes the need to run
\fBg2asc\fP(1) and
\fBasc2g\fP(1) on a database to move it between
computers (historically this was a way to work around the
platform\-specific nature of v4 files). The latest BRL\-CAD geometry
database format is platform\-independent.

.SH "DIAGNOSTICS"
.sp
Numerous error conditions are possible, usually due to errors in the
geometry database. Descriptive messages are printed on standard error
(file descriptor 2).
