== NAME

fbframe - place a colored frame around a framebuffer

== SYNOPSIS

*fbframe* [-F _framebuffer_] [-w|W _frame_width_] [-n|N _frame_height_] [-s|S _squareframesize_]

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*fbframe* places a colored frame around the edge pixels of a
framebuffer. It is mostly for purposes of framebuffer alignment. The
[opt]*-F* option can be used to specify the framebuffer. If this
option is omitted, the environment variable [var]`FB_FILE` is used to
select the display device (see
xref:man:1/brlcad.adoc[*brlcad*(1)]). If the variable is not set, the
default device for your system will be used.

The frame starts in the lower left with a red line running to the
right to the next to last pixel.  Next, a green line from there up to
the next to top scan line is drawn.  Then blue across the top scan
line to the next to first column.  Finally a white line down the left
edge stopping just above the red line.

By default, the dimensions of the frame will be taken from the
framebuffer used.  Alternatively, one or more of the options
[opt]*-s*, [opt]*-w*, [opt]*-n* (or [opt]*-S*, [opt]*-W*, [opt]*-N*)
may be used to set the dimensions of the frame drawn.

The options [opt]*-w* (or [opt]*-W*) [rep]_frame_width_ and [opt]*-n*
(or [opt]*-N*) [rep]_frame_height_ are used to specify the width (in
pixels) and height (in scanlines) of the frame on the framebuffer
respectively. The [opt]*-s* (or [opt]*-S*) [rep]_squareframesize_
option specifies both the height and width of the frame to be drawn.
