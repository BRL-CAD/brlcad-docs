= KNOB(nged)

== NAME

knob - Provides a method for simulating knob input. With no options,
it will display the current values for the knobs.

== SYNOPSIS

*knob* [-e -i -m -v] [[-o] | [v] | [m] | [e] | [k]] +[+[zap] | [zero] | [_id_ [_val_]]]

== DESCRIPTION

CAUTION: The [cmd]_knob_ command is used internally by MGED in the
processing of knob input devices and is not recommended for users.

The [cmd]*knob* command provides a method for simulating knob
input. With no options, it will display the current values for the
knobs. With the [cmd]*zap or zero* command provided, all the knob
values will be reset to zero. If an _id_ and _value_ are provided, the
specified knob setting will be simulated. If the _-i_ option is
specified, then the value provided will be used as an increment to be
applied to the indicated knob. The knobs have different functions
depending on the current mode. For example, if in primitive or matrix
edit mode and a rotation or translation function is selected, the knob
effects are applied to the edited object by default. However, the
_-v_(view coordinates) and _-m_ (model coordinates) options may be
used to adjust the view without modifying primitives or matrices.  The
_-e_ option allows the knob effects to be applied to the edited object
when they would normally be applied to the view. The _-o_ option
allows the origin of rotation to be specified with _v, m, e,_ and _k_,
indicating view, model, eye, and keypoint, respectively. The units for
_value_ are degrees for rotation and local units for translation. The
available _knob ids_ are:

* *x* -- rate-based rotation about horizontal axis.
* *y* -- rate-based rotation about vertical axis.
* *z* -- rate-based rotation about axis normal to screen.
* *X* -- rate-based translation in horizontal direction.
* *Y* -- rate-based translation in vertical direction.
* *Z* -- rate-based translation in direction normal to screen.
* *S* -- rate-based Scale or Zoom.
* *ax* -- absolute rotation about horizontal axis.
* *ay* -- absolute rotation about vertical axis.
* *az* -- absolute rotation about axis normal to screen.
* *aX* -- absolute translation in horizontal direction.
* *aY* -- absolute translation in vertical direction.
* *aZ* -- absolute translation in direction normal to screen.
* *aS* -- absolute Scale or Zoom.
* *xadc* -- absolute translation of adc in horizontal direction
   (screen coordinates -2048 to +2048).
* *yadc* -- absolute translation of adc in vertical direction (screen
   coordinates -2048 to +2048).
* *ang1* -- absolute rotation of adc angle1 (degrees).
* *ang2* -- absolute rotation of adc angle2 (degrees).
* *distadc* -- distance setting of the adc (screen coordinates -2048
   to +2048).


== EXAMPLES

The example shows the use of the [cmd]*knob* command with the _y_
option to rotate a view about the vertical axis.

.Rotate a view about the vertical axis.
====
[prompt]#mged># [in]`knob y 1`

Starts the view rotating about the vertical axis.
