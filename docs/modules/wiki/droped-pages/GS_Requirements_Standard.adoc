= Notes on requirements

* The aim of user requirements capture is to produce an overall System
Requirements Model, one use at a time. This formalizes the client
needs and establishes a list of mandates. All design implementation
and testing models are generated from these requirements.
* The requirements model must be readable by all parties, aka, written
in terms that the client can understand. However, the requirements
must contain sufficient detail to facilitate:
 ** The developer's use of it to analyze and design the system.
 ** Testers use to generate tests.
 ** Documenters use to write user and system documentation.
* Requirements must be gathered and refined iteratively by discussion
among developers and clients.
* The goal is to produce a list of requirements where each requirement
precisely identifies a single function. If a requirement seems too
general or broad scoped, then break it down into smaller
requirements.
* During the process of identifying Requirements, new
link:GS_Actors_Standard[Actors] and new link:GS_Use-Cases_Standard[Use
Cases] will become appearent.
