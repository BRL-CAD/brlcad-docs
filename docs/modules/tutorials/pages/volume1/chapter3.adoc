In keeping with the UNIX philosophy of developing independent tools to
perform single, specific tasks and then linking the tools together in
a package, BRL-CAD is basically a collection of libraries, tools, and
utilities that work together to create, raytrace, and interrogate
geometry and manipulate files and data.  The basic data flow structure
of the package is illustrated below.
