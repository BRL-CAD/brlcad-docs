.SH "NAME"
tol \- Used with no arguments, tol lists the current tolerance settings.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBtol\fP [abs\fI#\fP] [rel\fI#\fP] [norm\fI#\fP] [dist\fI#\fP] [perp\fI#\fP] []
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The \fBtol\fP command, with no arguments, lists the current tolerance
settings. If the command line includes any of the keywords followed by
a number, then that tolerance setting will be modified. The keywords
are as follows:
.sp
\fITessellation tolerances:\fP The tessellation tolerances are used to
control the facetization of primitive shapes. If more than one
tolerance value is specified, the tessellation is performed to meet
the most stringent.
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
abs \(em This \fIabsolute\fP tolerance is specified in model units and
represents the maximum allowable error in the distance from the
actual shape surface to the tessellated surface.  An \fIabsolute\fP
tolerance of 0 means that the \fIabsolute\fP tolerance should be
ignored.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
rel \(em This \fIrelative\fP tolerance is specified in terms of a fraction
of the shape size. The value is multiplied by the size of the shape
to determine another bound on the maximum allowable error in the
distance from the actual shape surface to the tessellated surface. A
\fIrelative\fP tolerance of 0 means that the \fIrelative\fP tolerance should
be ignored.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
norm \(em This \fInormal\fP tolerance is specified in degrees and
represents the maximum angle between the actual shape surface normal
and the tessellated surface normal. A \fInormal\fP tolerance of 0 means
that the \fInormal\fP tolerance should be ignored.
.RE
.sp
\fICalculational tolerances:\fP The calculational tolerances are used in
evaluating the Boolean operations specified in a combination. This is
used, for example, in the \fBev, facetize,\fP and \fBbev\fP
commands.
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
dist \(em The \fIdistance\fP tolerance is specified in model units and
represents the minimum distance required between two vertices to
consider them distinct.
.RE
.sp
.RS 4
.ie n \{\
\h'-04'\(bu\h'+03'\c
.\}
.el \{\
.  sp -1
.  IP \(bu 2.3
.\}
perp \(em The \fIperpendicularity\fP tolerance is specified as the cosine
of an angle. Two objects will be considered perpendicular if the
cosine of the angle between them is less than the \fIperpendicularity\fP
tolerance. Similarly, two objects will be considered parallel if the
cosine of the angle between them is greater than 1.0, the
\fIperpendicularity\fP tolerance.
.RE
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
The example shows the use of the \fBtol\fP command to set the
relative and perpendicularity tolerances.
.sp
.B Example 1. Set the relative and perpendicularity tolerances.
.br
.RS 4
.sp
mged> \f(CRtol rel .05 perp 1e\-6\fP
.sp
Sets the \fIrelative\fP tolerance to 5% and the \fIperpendicularity\fP
tolerance to 1e\-06 (cosine of 89.9999Â°).
