benchmark \- runs the BRL\-CAD benchmark
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fI[OPTION=value] \fBbenchmark\fP [command] [OPTION=value] [RT_OPTIONS]\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The \fBbenchmark\fP suite will test the performance of a given system
by iteratively rendering several well\-known datasets into 512x512
images where performance metrics are documented and fairly well
understood. The local machine performance is compared to the base
system (called VGR) and a numeric "VGR" multiplier of performance is
computed.  This number is a simplified metric from which one may
qualitatively compare cpu and cache performance, versions of BRL\-CAD,
and different compiler characteristics.
.sp
Run without any arguments or variables set, the benchmark suite will
run a series of tests where it renders several image frames.  By
default, the benchmark suite will attempt to calibrate the intensity
of the test frames with the performance characteristics of the machine
running the tests.
.sp
There are several \fIOPTION\fP environment variables that will modify how
the BRL\-CAD benchmark behaves so that it may be run in a stand\-alone
environment:

The \fITIMEFRAME\fP, \fIMAXTIME\fP, \fIDEVIATION\fP, and \fIAVERAGE\fP options control
how the benchmark will proceed including how long it should take.
Each individual benchmark run will consume at least a minimum
\fITIMEFRAME\fP of wallclock time so that the results can stabilize.
After consuming at least the minimum \fITIMEFRAME\fP, additional frames
may be computed until the standard deviation from the last \fIAVERAGE\fP
count of frames is below the specified \fIDEVIATION\fP.  When a test is
run and it completes in less than \fITIMEFRAME\fP, the raytrace is
restarted using double the number of rays from the previous run.  If
the machine is fast enough, the benchmark may accelerate the number or
rays being fired.  These additional rays are hypersampled but without
any jitter, so it is effectively performing a multiplier amount of
work over the initial frame.
.sp
There are various \fIcommand\fPs that may be give to the BRL\-CAD
benchmark that cause it to perform various actions such as invoking
the computation tests or filesystem clean\-up:

\fIrun\fP \- initiate the benchmark analysis
.RE
.sp
When the benchmark completes, output should be saved to several log
files including a \(aqsummary\(aq file containing tabulated results, a
\(aqbenchmark.log\(aq file containing the output from a given run, and
multiple log files for each test frame. Use the \fIclean\fP and \fIclobber\fP
commands during execution to remove the files generated during the
benchmark.
.sp
The \fIclean\fP command removes the test pix and log files.  The \fIclobber\fP
command removes those same files as well as any *benchmark.log files
encountered, and prompting the user beforehand. The generated tabular
\fIsummary\fP file will not be removed automatically regardless of
invocation command.  The \fIsummary\fP file must always be manually
deleted.
