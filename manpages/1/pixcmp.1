.SH "NAME"
pixcmp \- compare two pix image files pixel by pixel
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBpixcmp\fP [\fIOPTIONS\fP] \fIFILE1\fP [\fIFILE2\fP [\fISKIP1\fP [\fISKIP2\fP]]]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBpixcmp\fP is a program to compare two BRL\-CAD pix image files
pixel by pixel (or byte by byte), optionally skipping initial pixels
(or bytes) in one or both input files.  The following \fIOPTIONS\fP are
available:
.sp
\fB\-b\fP
.RS 4
Use bytes instead of pixels for both processing and
output. This can be useful for comparing BW images or other data
files. With this option, the \fB\-i\fP SKIP values should be specified
as bytes instead of pixels.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-s\fP
.RS 4
Output a line per pixel (or per byte if using the \fB\-b\fP
option) where the values are the same.  Each line includes the pixel
(or byte) number counting from 1, the respective input values, and a
label.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-d\fP
.RS 4
Output a line per pixel (or per byte if using the \fB\-b\fP
option) where the values are different.  Each line includes the pixel
(or byte) number counting from 1, the respective input values, and a
label.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-q\fP
.RS 4
Be more quiet, suppressing additional printing typically sent
to standard error.  With the \fB\-s\fP and/or \fB\-d\fP options,
respective lines will still be printed to standard output, but without
header and summary information getting sent to standard error.
.sp
This option has no affect on error printing that can result during
abnormal exit of pixcmp.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-i\fP \fISKIP\fP
.RS 4
Skip the first SKIP pixels (or bytes if using the
\fB\-b\fP option) of input for FILE1 and FILE2.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-i\fP \fISKIP1:SKIP2\fP
.RS 4
Skip the first SKIP1 pixels (or bytes if using
the \fB\-b\fP option) of FILE1 and first SKIP2 pixels in FILE2.
.RE
.sp
SKIP1 and SKIP2 are the number of pixels (or bytes if using the
\fB\-b\fP option) to skip in each file.
.sp
If FILE is \fB\-\fP or missing, \fBpixcmp\fP reads from the standard
input.  If FILE1 and FILE2 are both standard input, then values must
be interleaved (e.g., r1r2g1g2b1b2r1r2g1g2b1b2...etc... for r1g1b1 and
r2g2b2 from two separate input streams).
.SH "RETURN VALUES"
.sp
The \fBpixcmp\fP utility returns \fB0\fP if there are no differences, \fB1\fP
if there are only off\-by\-one differences, \fB2\fP if there are off\-by\-many
errors, \fB126\fP if there are file processing problems, and \fB127\fP if
there are argument processing or usage errors.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
\f(CRpixcmp \-d file1 file2\fP
.sp
The two files are compared pixel by pixel with each difference printed
instead of just the summary.
.sp
\f(CRpixdiff file1.pix file2.pix | pixcmp \- file3.pix\fP
.sp
The \fIpixdiff\fP tool compares the pixels in file1.pix with those in
file2.pix and then outputs a resulting \f(CRdiff\fP image which is then
processed by \fBpixcmp\fP as input and compared against file3.pix,
reporting on the differences.
.sp
\f(CRecho \-n "aabcddeg" | pixcmp \-b \-s \-d \- \-\fP
.sp
Here, pixcmp reads interleaved data from the system \fBecho\fP
command (\-n avoids a trailing newline) provided via standard input.
For each pair of characters (i.e., bytes), it reports their status:
.sp
.if n .RS 4
.nf
#Byte FILE1 FILE2 LABEL
1  97  97 MATCHING
2  98  99 OFF_BY_ONE
3 100 100 MATCHING
4 101 103 OFF_BY_MANY
pixcmp bytes:        2 matching,        1 off by 1,        1 off by many
