= ProE-BRL

BRL-CAD has a ProE-BRL export plugin for Pro/ENGINEER (i.e., ProE)
providing a means to import geometry from ProE into BRL-CAD.

The plugin runs within Pro/E and exports geometry in _polygonal_ format
for use with BRL-CAD. Geometry is written into our ".asc" ASCII format
which can be converted to our ".g" binary format with _asc2g_ or or by
sourcing the file into mged with the _source_ command.

Note that the prescribed workflow with the ProE-BRL converter is a
_fundamentally lossy_ process that changes the representation format of
the original geometry. The conversion to polygonal mesh geometry can
introduce _new_ overlaps on valid geometry or even fail outright (within
Pro/E) if there are modeling errors. This time-intensive process is
being deprecated by our active BREP/NURBS development effort.
