VGR was a modified DEC VAX11/780 with a second CPU that operated at the
Ballistics Research Laboratory in Aberdeen, MD. Early versions of
BRL-CAD were developed on this machine in the late 1970's and early
1980's and the performance became the baseline for the BRL-CAD benchmark
suite, measured in VGRs.

The name is a reference to the original Star Trek movie.
