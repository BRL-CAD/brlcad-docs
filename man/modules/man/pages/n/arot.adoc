= AROT(nged)

== NAME

arot - Performs a rotation about the specified axis (x y z) using
screen units (-2048 to +2048).

== SYNOPSIS

*arot* {_x_} {_y_} {_z_} {_angle_}

== DESCRIPTION

Performs a rotation about the specified axis (_x y z_) using screen
units (-2048 to +2048). The amount of rotation is determined by
_angle_, which is in degrees. Exactly what is rotated and how it is
rotated are dependent on MGED's state as well as the state of the
display manager. For example, in normal viewing mode, this command
simply rotates the view. However, in primitive edit mode, it rotates
the shape being edited.

== EXAMPLES

The example demonstrates the use of the [cmd]*arot* command to rotate
a view or shape about the z axis.

.Rotating a view or shape 10 degrees about the z axis.
====
[prompt]#mged># [in]`arot 0 0 1 10`
