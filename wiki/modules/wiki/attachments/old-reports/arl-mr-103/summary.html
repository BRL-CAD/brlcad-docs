<h1>Summary</h1>
<p>
       In this paper we have presented a general, overview type of
       approach to geometric modeling with BRL-CAD.  We outlined
       the important link between the intended application and the
       overall requirements of the geometric model.  We looked at
       an approach to effective BRL-CAD database management, based
       on the design of the database structure itself.  We also
       presented some standard naming conventions that have proven
       effective for armored systems.  Finally, we discussed the
       philosophy of geometric modeling and presented a general
       plan to accomplish any modeling project.
