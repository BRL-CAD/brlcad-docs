Begin by creating a new database, name it [path]`bishop.g`.

Using the same commands for the base:

`[in]#in base.rcc rcc 0 0 0 0 0 0.7 2.25#` kbd:[ENTER]

`[in]#in body.trc trc 0 0 0.7 0 0 2.2 2.25 0.85#` kbd:[ENTER]

`[in]#in curve.tor tor 0 0 2.9 0 0 1 3.2 2.4#` kbd:[ENTER]

`[in]#in neck.rcc rcc 0 0 2.9 0 0 0.5 1.4#` kbd:[ENTER]

Now, coming to the head of the bishop, you will use two shapes for it,
*sph* and *trc*.
The sphere starts from the base of `neck.rcc`, therefore the vertex of
this sphere equals to vertex of `neck.rcc` + radius of the sphere i.e.,
`2.9` + `1.1` = `4`. Type:

`[in]#in head.sph sph 0 0 4.0 1.1#` kbd:[ENTER]


The top has vertex `0 0 4.4`, where `4.4` = z value vertex of
`head.sph` (`4.0`) + (`0.4`)

`[in]#in headtop.trc trc 0 0 4.4 0 0 1.2 1 0.25#` kbd:[ENTER]

Since you have got all the shapes, you have an output like this in the
*Front* view:

Make the region:

`[in]#r bishop.r u base.rcc u body.trc - curve.tor u neck.rcc u
head.sph u headtop.trc#` kbd:[ENTER]

Assign material properties:

`[in]#mater bishop.r plastic 0 0 0 0#` kbd:[ENTER]

Before you Raytrace, donâ€™t forget to blast your region using the
command

`[in]#B bishop.r#` kbd:[ENTER]

Now Raytrace it with a white background. The front view after we
raytracing looks like this:
