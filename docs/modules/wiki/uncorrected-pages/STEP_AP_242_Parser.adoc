STEP is the current standard for exchange of CAD data between different
software packages. BRL-CAD makes use of the STEPcode project to
implement its step-g importer, but it is currently hard-wired to the
AP203 application protocol.

For this project, you'll get an AP242 parser working within our step-g
importer. You'll heavily document everything you do, keep notes on and
discuss any issues encountered, and try to import as much geometry as
possible from an AP242 source data file.
