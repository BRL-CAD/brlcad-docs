= Projecto VeRDE: Vehicle for Collecting Space Debris

****
This is a brief article regarding a project from within our user
community where BRL-CAD was put to use. It's a science project from
three young ladies who, in the span of just a couple months, went from
knowing absolutely nothing about modeling and BRL-CAD to creating a
CAD model of their concept with rendered images and
animations. Raquel, Marta, and Teresa used BRL-CAD for their project
to model and visualize a space vehicle they designed.

The project is named "`Projecto VeRDE`". Translating to English may
sound strange as "Green Project", but in Portuguese 'VeRDE' is the
abbreviation of
http://observatoriosatalaia.blogspot.com/2009/05/projecto-verde-veiculo-de-recolha-de.html[Veículo
de Recolha de Detritos Espaciais].  In English, this is a "Vehicle for
Collecting Space Debris".

The idea behind the project is that planet Earth is surrounded by
space junk that endangers astronauts and represents a very expensive
risk to space infrastructures like the International Space Station
(ISS), the Hubble Space Telescope, and other functioning
satellites. The goal of this space vehicle is 1) to reduce the amount
of space debris in Low Earth Orbit (LEO) and 2) to construct a "`space
truck`" with environmentally friendly components and electronic
systems that already exist in satellites and space shuttles.

The students conducted research on prospective vehicle components by
surveying various space companies`' websites that sell materials to
the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the European
Space Agency (ESA), and others for building their space shuttles and
satellites. They discovered that there are already a variety of
components available such as:

* Radio Frequency Ion Thruster Assembly
* Actuator Drive Electronic
* Laser-reactive method for disposal of small space debris
* Protective coating for the vehicle surface
* Solar arrays, batteries, and sensors
* Mini-pulse tube cooler
* Avionics integrated control and data system electronics (ICDE)
* Magnetic torquers
* Antenna
* ... and more ...

Using this information regarding available components, a concept
vehicle design was constructed. The three high-school teenagers then
worked on creating a representation of their concept within the
BRL-CAD solid modeling system. Without any prior knowledge of BRL-CAD,
but after going through the available introductory tutorials (even
though they were in English), they were able to create a 3d model
concept prototype with material shader properties defined. They then
used BRL-CAD tools to render animation frames for a 360 degree
spinning visualization.

In orbit, space debris travels at a very high speed that can be
reduced with the help of lasers. This reduced speed lets the debris
enter inside the space vehicle. Then, with the help of a treadmill,
the debris can be clustered with a polymer. Afterwards the cluster of
space junk will be sent to the sun (the incinerator chamber) thanks to
the velocity that it gains from the treadmill plus the velocity of the
vehicle.

At a science fair in 2009 among 100 other projects, Raquel, Marta, and
Teresa received an honorable mention for their project at the
Electrical Museum in Lisbon, Portugal.

[quote,Raquel Albuquerque]
To create the design of our spaceship the BRL-CAD was a very useful
tool to create our 3D model.

Included above are rendered 360 degree spinning view video animations
of the spacecraft. Individual frames were rendered with BRL-CAD's
"xref:man:1/rt[rt]" ray tracer and composited with 3rd-party video
processing tools.

== Interview with Raquel

*Was this your first time using BRL-CAD?*

_Yes, it was. We didn't know anything about BRL-CAD until our teacher
told us about it and encouraged us to do the 3D model using BRL-CAD._

*How long would you estimate it took you to learn MGED / BRL-CAD?*

_First we all trained our skills by reading and doing some models
through BRL-CAD tutorials. This first learning step probably took
about two months because we were getting used to the code, language,
and dealing with the command window._

_I have to say that Teresa was the one who learned faster because she
got really excited with it, and I think during the whole modeling
process she became addicted to BRL-CAD! (After a couple months), I
think we were all equal in dealing with this application and became
BRL-CADaholics._

*How long did it take your team to model the space craft? How many
days or hours did it take?*

_We begin to model in BRL-CAD in November/December 2008 and we
finished it in April 2009,we didn't finish sooner because we also had
other subjects in school._

_We used BRL-CAD during classes about 3 hours per week, and we also
worked at home. Friday and Saturday evenings, we worked about 2 or 3
hours on average. Taking all this into account, we worked about 6
hours per week during 4 months, so... 96 hours approximately._

*What was the hardest aspect of using MGED / BRL-CAD?*

_Dealing with the Command Window was difficult at the beginning. We
were accustomed to moving and creating objects directly, with buttons,
arrows, and other widgets that simplify modeling actions. It appeared
more difficult, but our model became more precise due to the
coordinates and measurements that we inserted in the command window._

_But the hardest part was making the fly-around animation. We had the
script that's in BRL-CAD's website, but it was quite difficult to
understand and modify because we had never dealt with programming
languages before. But with Sean and our teacher's guidance it became
clear._

*What was the easiest aspect of using MGED / BRL-CAD?*

_When we got used to it, we realized that it was easier that we
thought at the beginning._

_I would say that the boolean operations were the easy part, due to
its precision and simplicity, by constructing complex objects with
basic geometric solids._
