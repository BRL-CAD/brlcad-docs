== NAME

orot - Performs a rotation of an object during matrix edit.
   

== SYNOPSIS

*orot* [-i] {_xdeg ydeg zdeg_}

== DESCRIPTION

Performs a rotation of an object during matrix edit. The rotation is performed, in order: _xdeg_ about the _x_ axis, then _ydeg_ about the __y__axis, and finally _zdeg_ about the _z_ axis. If the__-i__ flag is given, then the angles are interpreted as increments to the last object 	rotation. The [cmd]*rotobj* command is a synonym for _orot._

== EXAMPLES

The example shows the use of the [cmd]*orot* command to rotate a currently edited object. 

.Rotate a currently edited object.
