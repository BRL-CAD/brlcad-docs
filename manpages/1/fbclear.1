.SH "NAME"
fbclear \- clear a frame buffer image
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBfbclear\fP [\-c] [\-F \fIframebuffer\fP] [\fIred\fP \fIgreen\fP \fIblue\fP]
.br
[\-c] [\-F \fIframebuffer\fP] [\fIgray_value\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBfbclear\fP is used to erase a frame buffer using whatever method
is efficient for the device being accessed. By default, the selected
color will be flooded into the color planes. If the \fB\-c\fP option
is used, a standard linear colormap will be loaded and the pan and
zoom values will be reset.
.sp
If the optional color values are given, \fBfbclear\fP writes the
specified color over the entire image. The color values must be in the
range 0 to 255. In the second form shown above, the single gray_value
is written into all three color channels.
.sp
The frame buffer to be cleared is determined from the \fB\-F\fP option
if given. Otherwise the environment variable \f(CRFB_FILE\fP is used to
select the display device (see
\fBbrlcad\fP(1)). If this variable is not set, the
default device for your system will be used.
.sp
In addition to those flags shown above, the \fB\-W\fP (or \fB\-w\fP)
\fIwidth\fP, \fB\-N\fP (or \fB\-n\fP) \fIheight\fP, and \fB\-S\fP
(or \fB\-s\fP) \fIsquare_size\fP options can be used to set the size
of the output frame buffer.
