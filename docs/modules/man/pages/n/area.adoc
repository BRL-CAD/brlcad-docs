= AREA(nged)

== NAME

area - Calculates an approximate presented area of one region in the
mged display.

== SYNOPSIS

*area* [_tolerance_]

== DESCRIPTION

Calculates an approximate presented area of one region in the mged
display. For this command to work properly, a single BRL-CAD region
must be displayed using the [cmd]*E* command. The _tolerance_ is the
distance required between two vertices in order for them to be
recognized as distinct vertices. This calculation considers only the
minimum bounding polygon of the region and ignores holes.
