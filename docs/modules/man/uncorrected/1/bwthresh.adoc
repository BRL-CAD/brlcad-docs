== NAME

bwthresh - threshold a black-and-white bw file

== SYNOPSIS

*bwthresh*_val_...<_file.bw_

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*bwthresh* reads from standard input a stream of black-and-white data in xref:man:5/bw.adoc[*bw*(5)] format and thresholds it among the __val__s, writing the resulting xref:man:5/bw.adoc[*bw*(5)] data to standard output. The __val__s must appear on the command line in strictly increasing order.

The grey scale 0..255 is divided evenly into __n__+1 bins, and each pixel of input is compared to the __val__s, to determine which of the __n__+1 grey levels should be output.

== EXAMPLE

The command

bwthresh 37 143 < _file.bw_ > _file2.bw_

performs the following mapping:

if (pixel_in < 37) pixel_out = 0 else if (pixel_in < 143) pixel_out = 128 else pixel_out = 255
