= Inserting an _ebm_ shape in MGED

== Making an image with GIMP

First, we must make an image with GIMP. This image contains the text,
or a two dimensional shape that should be loaded into MGED model as
_ebm_.

The image must have a *black* background and a *white* foreground.

To get a nice _ebm_, the new GIMP image should have at least (?) 350 x
350 pixels (width and height).

In GIMP we must change the Image Mode to Indexed Colors with
'Black-white, using the (1 bit) palette' option.

We must save this image in PNG format. In the Save dialog box we must
check the 'Save with Background' option.

We must write down somewhere the dimensions in pixels of this image
(e.g., 350x350), as this information will be needed when the _ebm_ is
created in MGED.

== Converting a PNG file into a bitmap file

This can be done with the following command at the shell prompt in an
XTERM window on GNU/Linux systems.

....
$ png-bw image_name.png > image_name.bw
Warning: color image being converted to B/W!!!
....

We get the warning shown above and this is good. :)

== Inserting _ebm_ in MGED

`mged> in text1.s ebm f image_name.bw 350 350 20`

If we don't type the dimensions (in pixels) of the file
_image_name.png_ exactly as it was created, the _ebm_ shape that we get
will not be the desired result.

If we made a region of this _ebm_ and raytraced it, then we can see
something like the picture below.

== Creating _ebm_ with database objects

An alternative method to create an _ebm_ is to use a binary database
object, which can store a .bw file's data, rather than directly use a
.bw file as the data source. While the results will be the same, the
advantage of this approach is that the _ebm_ does not need to rely on an
external file, meaning that it will still function even without the
presence of the original .bw file. This can be done through the
following steps:

The first step is to actually create the binary database object that
will store the .bw file data. This can be done through the "bo"
command.

`mged> bo -i u C dbobj image_name.bw`

This uses the contents of the file "image_name.bw" to create a binary
database object of unsigned characters called "dbobj." Note that "C"
is used to denote the unsigned char type, as this is what _ebm_ reads.

Creating an _ebm_ using the binary database object as the data source
is similar to before, with a few exceptions.

`mged> in text2.s ebm o dbobj 350 350 20`

In this case, there is an "o" indicating an object source instead of
an "f", and the name of the source is now the name of the binary
database object rather than the name of a file.

Once the _ebm_ has been created, the original .bw file can be removed
as its data will still be stored internally within the binary database
object.
