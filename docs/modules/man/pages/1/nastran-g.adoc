== NAME

nastran-g - NASTRAN Translator (NASTRAN to BRL-CAD)

== SYNOPSIS

*nastran-g* [-xX _lvl_] [-t _tolerance_distance_] [-n] [-m] -i _nastran_input_file_ -o _database.g_

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*nastran-g* converts the specified _nastran_input_file_ to a
BRL-CAD _database.g_ file. The _tolerance_distance_ provided is the
maximum distance (in mm) between two vertices at which they will be
considered to be the same vertex. The [opt]*-n* option requests that
the output solids created from _NASTRAN CQUAD4_ or _CTRIA3_ elements
be stored in the BRL-CAD file as NMG solids rather than as the default
BOT solids. The [opt]*-m* option indicates that the units of the
NASTRAN file are millimeters, rather than the default inches. The
converter currently only handles the _CROD, CBAR, CTRIA3,_ and
_CQUAD4_ elements.

The [opt]*-x* and [opt]*-X* options are for debug levels. 

== EXAMPLE

....
$ nastran-g -i nastran.file -o sample.g
