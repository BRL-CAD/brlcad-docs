.SH "NAME"
check \- Check is a geometry analysis tool.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBcheck\fP \fIsub\-command\fP [\fIoptions\fP] [\fIobjects\fP]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The \fBcheck\fP program computes and reports a variety of
characteristics of the \fIobjects\fP specified from the opened
database. The characteristics which can be computed include \fBmass,
centroid, moments of inertia, volume, overlaps, surface area, exposed
air, gaps/voids, unconfined air\fP and \fBadjacent air.\fP Only the
\fIobjects\fP from the database specified on the command line are
analyzed.
.sp
It works by shooting grids of rays from the three axis\-aligned
directions (sometimes called \fIviews\fP) or a single view when
azimuth/elevation angles are mentioned.
.sp
For volume/mass/surface area calculations the resulting calculations
for each view are compared to each other. The grid of rays is
progressively refined until the results from all three views agree
within a user\-specifiable tolerance, or a limit on grid refinement is
reached.
.sp
For mass/centroid/moments of inertia calculations it is suggested for
better accuracy to opt for three axis\-aligned grid by not mentioning
azimuth/elevation angles.
.sp
For surface area calculations, the rays are fired from three grids at
random azimuth/elevation angles and then taken mean of the values
reported by the three grids at the end.
.SH "SUBCOMMANDS"
.sp
\fBadj_air\fP
.RS 4
Detects air volumes which are next to each other but have
different air_code values applied to the region. This would typically
indicate that the regions are different types of air, such as crew_air
(which fills the crew compartment of a vehicle) and engine_air (which
surrounds the engine). When these different types of air adjoin each
other, it is generally considered a modeling error.
.RE
.sp
\fBcentroid\fP
.RS 4
Computes the centroid of the objects specified.
.RE
.sp
\fBexp_air\fP
.RS 4
This causes checks to be made to see if the ray encounters
air regions before (or after all) solid objects. It also checks to see
if the ray moves from a void to an air region. Typically, only the air
inside a building or vehicle is modeled if the purpose of the model is
to support analysis of that single structure/vehicle. There are
exceptions, such as when modeling larger environments for more
extended analysis purposes.
.RE
.sp
\fBgap\fP
.RS 4
This reports when there is more than overlap_tol_dist (see the
\-t option below) between objects on the ray path. Note that not all
gaps are errors. For example, gaps between a wheel and a fender are
expected (unless external air is modeled). Typically, users should
perform gap analysis on contained subsets of a model (such as
passenger compartments) rather than on whole vehicles.
.RE
.sp
\fBmass\fP
.RS 4
Computes the mass of the objects specified.
.RE
.sp
\fBmoments\fP
.RS 4
Computes the moments and products of inertia of the
objects specified.
.RE
.sp
\fBoverlaps\fP
.RS 4
This reports overlaps, when two regions occupy the same
space. In the real world, two objects may not occupy the same
space. This check is sometimes also known as interference
checking. Two objects must overlap by at least overlap_tol_dist (see
the \-t option below) to be considered to overlap.
.RE
.sp
\fBsurf_area\fP
.RS 4
Computes the surface area of the objects specified.
.RE
.sp
\fBunconf_air\fP
.RS 4
This reports when a partition with nonzero air code
follows or precedes another partition and the space between them is
more than overlap_tol_dist (see the \-t option). The data reported are
the names of the two regions (and solids) involved, the length of the
gap along the ray, and the model coordinates of the ray\(cqs exiting the
first partition and entering the second
.RE
.sp
\fBvolume\fP
.RS 4
Computes the volume of the objects specified.
.RE
.SH "MASS CALCULATION"
.sp
If mass calculation is selected, a value is calculated and reported
for each \fIobject\fP specified on the command line. \fBNote that if there
are overlaps or other errors in the geometry, the values reported will
be invalid.\fP
.sp
For mass computation, the density of every region must be
specified. Densities are specified as an index in a table of density
values. This index is stored in the \fIGIFTmater\fP attribute of each
region (typically set with the \fIedcodes\fP or \fIadjust\fP commands in
MGED).
.sp
The density table consists of three columns:
.sp
\fIAn integer index value\fP.
.RS 4
This is the value to which the \fIGIFTmater\fP
attribute will be set to select this material for the region.
.RE
.sp
\fIA floating point density value\fP.
.RS 4
This is the density for the
material, and is specified in \fBgrams/cc\fP.
.RE
.sp
\fIA name string\fP.
.RS 4
This is a name or description the material.
.RE
.sp
An example file might look like the following:
.sp
The table is typically created in an external file using a text
editor.
.sp
The geometry editor MGED automatically assigns an index value of \f(CR1\fP
to a newly created region. While this default can be handy when a vast
majority of objects are made from the same material, it can lead to
surprising errors when objects which are supposed to have a certain
mass are computed to have different mass because one or two regions
were not set to the correct, non\-default index value.  As a result, it
is advised that the index value \f(CR1\fP never be used. If this practice is
followed, then an error message will be generated for any regions
which have not had their material index set to something other than
the default.
.sp
The user will typically want to run \fBgqa\fP and verify the results
using the \fB\-f\fP option (see below) before importing the table into
the database. For example, if a material index is left out of the
table, it is easier to rectify the situation using the external
file. Once the table has been verified as correct and complete, it is
imported to the database as the binary object \fB_DENSITIES\fP . To import
the text file into the database, the following command is used:
.sp
mged> \f(CRbo \-i u c \fIDENSITIES [rep]_filename\fP\fP
.SH "GEOMETRY ERROR DETECTION"
.sp
All of these calculations run until the grid refinement limit is
reached.
.sp
For each pair of regions that cause an error, the tool reports the two
erroneous regions, the maximum line\-of\-sight thickness of the error,
and the in\-hit location of the ray that caused that maximum error
thickness.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-a\fP \fIazimuth_deg [deg|rad]\fP
.RS 4
Sets a rotation (in degrees) of the
coordinate system by a given amount about the Z axis. When mentioned,
check shoots only one grid of rays along the azimuth/elevation
angle. The default is 35.  See also \fB\-e\fP .
.RE
.sp
\fB\-e\fP \fIelevation_deg [deg|rad]\fP
.RS 4
Sets a rotation (in degrees) of the
coordinate system by a given elevation from the XY plane (rotation
about X axis?). When mentioned, check shoots only one grid of rays
along the azimuth/elevation angle. The default is 25. See also
\fB\-a\fP .
.RE
.sp
\fB\-d\fP
.RS 4
Enables debugging (off by default).
.RE
.sp
\fB\-f\fP \fIfilename\fP
.RS 4
Specifies that density values should be taken from
an external file instead of from the \fB_DENSITIES\fP object in the
database. This option can be useful when developing the density table
with a text editor, prior to importing it to the geometric database.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-g\fP [\fIinitial_grid_spacing\fP\-] \fIgrid_spacing_limit\fP or [\fIinitial_grid_spacing\fP,] \fIgrid_spacing_limit\fP
.RS 4
Specifies a limit on how far the grid can be refined and optionally
the initial spacing between rays in the grids. The first value (if
present) indicates the initial spacing between grid rays.  The
mandatory argument, \fIgrid_spacing_limit\fP, indicates a lower bound on
how fine the grid spacing may get before computation is terminated.
In general, the \fIinitial_grid_spacing\fP value should be an integer
power of the \fIgrid_spacing_limit\fP.  So for example, if
\fIgrid_spacing_limit\fP has the value 1, then any \fIinitial_grid_spacing\fP
specified should be in the sequence 2, 4, 8, 16, 32... so that the
grid will refine to precisely the lower limit. The grid spacing may be
specified with units.  For example: \fB5 mm\fP or \fB10 in\fP .  If units are
not provided, millimeters are presumed to be the units.
.sp
The default values are 50.0 mm and 0.5 mm, which is equivalent to
specifying: \fB\-g 50.0mm\-0.5mm\fP or \fB\-g 50.0mm,0.5mm\fP on the
command line.  This is a hard limit.  If other analysis constraints
are not met, the grid spacing will never be refined smaller than the
minimum grid size to satisfy another constraint.  The initial grid
spacing is divided in half at each refinement step.  As a result, if
you desire a lower limit to actually be tested, then the initial grid
size must be a power of 2 greater.  For example, specifying \-g10mm,1mm
would result in grid spacings of 10, 5, 2.5, 1.25 being used.  If the
goal was to exactly end at a 1mm grid, then values such as 8 or 16
should have been chosen for the initial values.  This would result in
testing 16, 8, 4, 2, 1 grid spacing values.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-G\fP [\fIgrid_width\fP,] \fIgrid_height\fP
.RS 4
sets the grid size, if only grid
width is mentioned then a \fIsquare\fP grid size is set.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-i\fP
.RS 4
Gets \(aqview information\(aq from the view to setup the eye position
of the single grid.  Used only for \fIoverlaps\fP calculations.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-M\fP \fImass_tolerance[units]\fP
.RS 4
This is like the volume tolerance,
\fB\-V\fP, but is applied to the mass computation results, not the
volume computation results.
.sp
The mass computation tolerance is probably more appropriate when doing
whole\-vehicle analysis. If mass computation is selected, it is set to
a value equal to the mass of an object 1/100 the size of the model,
which is made of the most dense material in the table.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-n\fP \fInum_hits\fP
.RS 4
Specifies that the grid be refined until each region
has at least \fInum_hits\fP ray intersections.  It applies only when mass
or volume calculations are being performed.  This limit is not applied
per\-view, but rather per\-analysis. So, for example, it is accepted
that a thin object might not be hit at all from one view, but might be
hit when it is shot from other views.
.sp
The default is 1.  Hence, each region must be intersected by a ray at
least once during the analysis.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-N\fP \fInum_views\fP
.RS 4
Specifies that only the first \fInum_views\fP should be
computed.  This is principally a debugging option.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-o\fP
.RS 4
Specifies to display the \fIoverlaps\fP as overlays.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-p\fP
.RS 4
Specifies that \fBcheck\fP should produce plot files for each
of the analyses it performs.  These can be overlaid on the geometry in
\fImged\fP with the \fIoverlay\fP command to help visualize the analysis
results. Each of the different analysis types write to a separate plot
file and use different colors for drawing.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-P\fP \fIncpu\fP
.RS 4
Specifies that \fIncpu\fP CPUs should be used for performing
the calculation. By default, all local CPUs are utilized. This option
exists primarily to reduce the number of computation threads from the
machine maximum.  Note that specifying more CPUs than are present on
the machine does not increase the number of computation threads.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-q\fP
.RS 4
Quiets (suppresses) the "was not hit" reporting.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-r\fP
.RS 4
Indicates that \fBcheck\fP should print per\-region statistics
for mass, volume and surface area as well as the values for the
objects specified on the command line.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-R\fP
.RS 4
Disables the reporting of overlaps. Used only for \fIoverlaps\fP
sub\-command.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-s\fP \fIsurf_area_tolerance\fP
.RS 4
Specifies a \fIsurface area tolerance\fP
value that the three view computations must be within for computation
to complete. If surface area calculation is selected and this option
is not set, then the tolerance is set to 1/1,000 of the estimated
surface area of the model bounding box.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-S\fP \fIsamples_per_model_axis\fP
.RS 4
Specifies that the grid spacing will
be initially refined so that at least \fIsamples_per_axis_min\fP will be
shot along each axis of the bounding box of the model. For example, if
the objects specified have a bounding box of 0 0 0 \(-> 4 3 2 and the
grid spacing is 1.0, specifying the option \fB\-S 4\fP will cause the
initial grid spacing to be adjusted to 0.5 so that 4 samples will be
shot across the Z dimension of the bounding box. The default is to
ensure 1 ray per model grid axis.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-t\fP \fIoverlap_tolerance\fP
.RS 4
Sets the tolerance for computing overlaps.
The \fIoverlap_tolerance\fP must be a positive number equal to or greater
than 0.0.  Any overlap smaller than the value specified will be
ignored. The default value is 0.0, which causes any overlap to be
reported/processed. The value may be specified with a unit specifier
such as: \fB\-t 1.0mm\fP or \fB\-t 0.25in.\fP
.RE
.sp
\fB\-U\fP \fIuse_air\fP
.RS 4
Specifies the Boolean value (0 or 1) for \fIuse_air\fP
which indicates whether regions which are marked as "air" should be
retained and included in the raytrace. \fBUnlike other BRL\-CAD
raytracing applications, the default is to retain air in the
raytracing.\fP The \fB\-U 0\fP option causes air regions to be discarded
prior to raytracing.  If you turn off use_air, and request any
analysis that requires it (see \fB\-A\fP above), then the program will
exit with an error message.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-u\fP \fIdistance_units,volume_units,mass_units\fP
.RS 4
Specify the units used
when reporting values.  Values must be comma delimited and provided in
the order \fIdistance_units\fP,\fIvolume_units\fP, \fImass_units\fP.  For example:
\fB\-u "cm,cu ft,kg"\fP or \fB\-u ,,kg\fP (The latter example sets
only the mass units.) Note that unit values with spaces in their names
such as \fIcu ft\fP must be contained in quotes for the shell to keep the
values together.
.sp
The default units are millimeters, cubic millimeters, and grams.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-v\fP
.RS 4
Turns on verbose reporting of computation progress.  This is
useful for learning how the computation is progressing, and what
tolerances are causing further computation to be necessary.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-V\fP \fIvolume_tolerance[units]\fP
.RS 4
Specifies a volumetric tolerance
value that the three view computations must be within for computation
to complete.  If volume calculation is selected and this option is not
set, then the tolerance is set to 1/1,000 of the volume of the model
bounding box. For large, complex objects (such as entire vehicles),
this value might need to be set larger to achieve reasonable runtime
(or even completion). Given the approximate sampling nature of the
algorithm, the three separate view computations will not usually
produce identical results.
