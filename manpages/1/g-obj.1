g\-obj \- BRL\-CAD to Wavefront Object File converter

.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBg\-obj\fP converts the specified \fIobject(s)\fP from a BRL\-CAD
\fIdatabase.g\fP file to the \fIWavefront\fP \fIOBJ\fP file format. The \fB\-x\fP
option specifies an RT debug flag and the \fB\-X\fP option specifies
an NMG debug flag. The \fB\-a\fP , \fB\-r\fP , and \fB\-n\fP options
specify tessellation tolerances. The \fB\-P\fP option specifies the
number of CPUs. The \fB\-D\fP option specifies a calculational
distance tolerance (mm). Any two vertices that are less than this
distance apart will be treated as the same vertex. The \fB\-u\fP
option specifies that vertex normals are desired. The \fB\-v\fP option
requests verbose output. The \fB\-i\fP option requests the output file
units to be inches (the default is mm). The \fB\-o\fP option specifies
the name of the file to receive the output (stdout is the
default). The \fB\-m\fP option will result in \(aqusemtl\(aq statements in
the output file. These statements are fictional (they do not refer to
any material database). The materials named provide information about
the material codes assigned to the objects in the BRL\-CAD
database. The material names will be of the form
\(aqaircode_los_material\(aq, where \fIaircode\fP is the code number for the air
represented by that region, if it does represent air, otherwise this
will be zero. The \fIlos\fP is the Line Of Sight thickness (0\-100)
assigned to the region, and the \fImaterial\fP is the material code number
assigned. The \fB\-e\fP option specifies a file for receiving the
error messages.
