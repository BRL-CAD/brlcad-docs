There is no fundamental reason the BRL-CAD raytracer cannot produce High
Dynamic Range output, but it currently does not do so and BRL-CAD's
image tools do not support it.

This task would involve:

. Investigating the OpenEXR image file format for suitability for use
in BRL-CAD
. Identify BRL-CAD libraries and tools that would need to be enhanced
(either to support OpenEXR or some other format)
. Allow BRL-CAD raytracing to generate HDRI output
. Allow BRL-CAD image editing and display tools to work with HDRI
output

The end product should be an enhanced raytracer and toolchain that can
produce and handle HDRI images.
