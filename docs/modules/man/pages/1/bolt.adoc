== NAME

bolt - Creates a BRL-CAD .g file containing bolts.
  

== SYNOPSIS

*bolt* [_options_]...

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*bolt* is a program to create a BRL-CAD data base of one of four
different kinds of bolts.  Up to twenty-six bolts of one type and size
may be created. [cmd]*bolt* uses libwdb to create a database file.
This program may be run interactively or the user may specify options
on a command line.  If the user chooses to run the program
interactively he answers the questions as the program prompts him.
Below are the options that can be used on the command line.

== OPTIONS

*-o#* :: Type of bolt to be created:
+
* 1 => bolt head
* 2 => bolt head and washer
* 3 => bolt head, washer, and bolt stem
* 4 => bolt head and bolt stem

*-f* _name.g_ :: BRL-CAD file name.

*-n #* :: The number of bolts to be created.  This number must be less
than or equal to 26 (or it will be set to 26).

*-hd #* :: Diameter of bolt head, flat edge to flat edge, in
millimeters.

*-hh #* :: Height of bolt head in millimeters.

*-wd #* :: Diameter of washer in millimeters.

*-wh #* :: Height of washer in millimeters.

*-sd #* :: Diameter of bolt stem in millimeters.

*-sh #* :: Height of bolt stem in millimeters.
