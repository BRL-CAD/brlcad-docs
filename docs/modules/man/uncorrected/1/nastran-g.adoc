== NAME

nastran-g - NASTRAN Translator (NASTRAN to BRL-CAD)

== SYNOPSIS

*nastran-g*[-xX _lvl_][-t _tolerance_distance_][-n][-m]-i _nastran_input_file_-o _database.g_

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*nastran-g* converts the specified __nastran_input_file__ to a BRL-CAD __database.g__ file. The __tolerance_distance__ provided is the maximum distance (in mm) between two vertices at which they will be considered to be the same vertex. The [opt]*-n* option requests that the output solids created from __NASTRAN CQUAD4__ or __CTRIA3__ elements be stored in the BRL-CAD file as NMG solids rather than as the default BOT solids. The [opt]*-m* option indicates that the units of the NASTRAN file are millimeters, rather than the default inches. The converter currently only handles the __CROD, CBAR, CTRIA3,__ and __CQUAD4__ elements.

The [opt]*-x* and [opt]*-X* options are for debug levels.
