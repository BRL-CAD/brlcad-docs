== NAME

g-x3d - Perform Boolean evaluations to produce an X3D facetted model

== SYNOPSIS

*g-x3d*[-v][-d _calc_dist_tol_][-a _abs_tess_tol_][-n _norm_tess_tol_][-r _rel_tess_tol_][-x _librt_debug_flag_][-X _NMG_debug_flag_][-u _units_name_][-P _\#_of_CPUs_][-o _outfile_]_infile.g__object(s)_

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*g-x3d* performs the Boolean operations specified in any regions in the specified __object(s)__ and writes the resulting facetted objects to __outfile__ or to __stdout__ if the [opt]*-o* option is not used. The output is in X3D facetted format. The [opt]*-v* option requests verbose output while the conversion is taking place. The [opt]*-d* option specifies a calculational distance tolerance (in millimeters). This tolerance is used to distinguish neighboring vertices. Any two vertices less than this tolerance distance apart will be considered the same vertex. The default value is 0.005mm. Prior to performing the Boolean operations for each region, the involved primitive solids are converted to a planar facetted approximation and stored as NMG solids. This tessellation can be controlled using the tessellation tolerances. The [opt]*-a* option may be used to specify an absolute tessellation tolerance (in millimeters). This requires that the maximum absolute error from the tessellated surface to the actual surface must not be greater than __abs_tess_tol__. The [opt]*-n* option specifies a surface normal error tolerance (in degrees) for the tessellation. The [opt]*-r* option may be used to set a relative error tolerance. This effectively sets an absolute tolerance for each primitive solid by multiplying the overall size of the solid by __rel_tess_tol__. The [opt]*-x* and [opt]*-X* options are used to set debug flags for __librt__ and the __NMG__ routines respectively. The definitions of these flags may be found in __raytrace.h__ and __nmg.h__. The [opt]*-u* option can be used to set the units for the resulting X3D file (the default is mm). Any units name that MGED accepts will work here.

The [opt]*-P* option sets the number of processors (default is 1).
