== Outline

The idea is to build a geometry viewer application that generates a
standalone double-clickable file that views a given model. The approach
is to concatenate the contents of a given "`.g`" file with the function
calls from librt and display a "`.g`" file, in a standard brlcad setup.

Our source code will generate an executable, we will then separately
concatenate a ".g" file into this executable:

This executable is capable of:

. Finding the start of ".g" file bytes/headers
. Populating the g file database for librt
. Plotting the items in the g file using
http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/pages.html[glfw3].

Our motivation is to introduce portability and ability to share results
of brlcad via email with users who don't have brlcad setup in their
environments. First we will develop a standalone application but later
this can be integrated into mged or any other tool as a brlcad feature.

== Status (15.08.2016)

Our source code takes an embedded .g file and locates it's header bytes
from there on it calls db_open() by writing the gbytes into a temporary
file and populates struct db_i. The source also calls db_ls to get a
count of objects in the database and calls db_walk_tree on one of the
objects. Then work a list of all top level objects is fetched via db_ls
and then db_walk_tree is called on each of them. The next step is to
plot these zones, for this purpose we have decided to choose
http://www.glfw.org/docs/latest/pages.html[glfw3]. Currently the work
is being done to generate a simple window from our application using
glfw.

== Task Breakdown

The brlcad suite has many tools and libraries that interact with each
other to render and view models. The general architecture is given
below:
image:Data_flow_structure.png[Data_flow_structure.png,396]

The most important part for us out of this architecture is the geometry
rendering libraries, to be more specific librt & libdm.

•
http://brlcad.sourceforge.net/doxygen/da/d12/group%5F%5Flibrt.html[*Librt*],
the library that contains all of the geometry support. It parses the
"`.g`" file and its function calls can be used to extract contents of "`g`"
file. We will use this to parse our model file for Libdm. The relevant
function call is "`db_open`". There is also possibility to use a higher
level library "`libged`" (ged_open)

•
http://brlcad.org/docs/doxygen-r64112/d4/de4/group%5F%5Flibdm.xhtml[*Libdm*]
is BRL-CAD's primary graphics display manager (dm) library. It is used
to display geometry in GUI. This will be utilized by our source to
visualize model files.

This resulting draw result will then be bundled into an executable
(Linux) and later into packages for Mac & Windows.

* Evaluate programming language choice (C decided, for GUI may use
some Python)

2. Evaluate and look into current viewer applications:

* Mged / archer
* Isst, it doesn't use libdm.
* Geometry viewer https://github.com/BRL-CAD/geometry_viewer[1]

3. Create Compiler Application:

First step is to merge .g file into executable and then read it's
contents. This is achieved by simply concatenating .g file with
executable using the Linux "cat" command e.g., *cat viewer moss.g >
exec*.

Then we locate the header bytes (hex) of the embedded .g file from
within the executable. From "hexdump" command we can conclude that .g
files have the bytes *(76 01 00 00 00 00 01 35)* in common:

[,bash]
----
hexdump -C build/share/db/wave.g | head
00000000  76 01 00 00 00 00 01 35  76 02 00 00 00 00 0a 00  |v......5v.......|
00000010  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 00  |................|
*
00000050  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 35  76 02 00 00 00 00 02 00  |.......5v.......|
00000060  00 00 00 00 00 00 00 35  76 20 00 20 01 04 1a 06  |.......5v . ....|


00000070  62 61 73 65 31 00 c0 40  82 c0 00 00 00 00 00 c0  |base1..@........|
----

Once the bytes have been located we have the option of either:

* {blank}
 ** Populating http://brlcad.org/docs/doxygen-r64112/d2/d66/structdb%5F%5Fi.xhtml[*struct
db_i*]
manually
 ** Getting a file descriptor of bytes in memory and passing it on
to
http://brlcad.org/docs/doxygen-r64112/d3/d9b/group%5F%5Fdbio.xhtml#gaa9eb8edb99fa1da5d188587e07d8dacc[*db_open*].

4. Create application Interface with librt

Librt is used to open brlcad geometry files and edit them. It reads a .g
file by calling the function
http://brlcad.org/docs/doxygen-r64112/d3/d9b/group%5F%5Fdbio.xhtml#gaa9eb8edb99fa1da5d188587e07d8dacc[*db_open*]
and populates a http://brlcad.org/docs/doxygen-r64112/d2/d66/structdb%5F%5Fi.xhtml[*db_i
structure*].
To view the geometry files we need
http://brlcad.org/docs/doxygen-r64112/d4/de4/group%5F%5Flibdm.xhtml[*Libdm*]
which takes this db_i structure as input to do so.

As we have located the g file bytes, we simply write out these bytes
onto a temporary file and pass this file onto db_open(). db_open then
populates the database structure db_i. An
http://brlcad.org/wiki/Example_db_walk_tree[*example*] is already
available that shows the usage of db_open. We are utilizing the
skeleton of this example to populate the struct db_i. A cleaner
approach would be to directly populate the struct db_i and I am working
on that.

The next step is to identify the top level objects of a g file. These
can be listed by issuing a
http://brlcad.org/wiki/MGED_CMD_tops["tops"] command on mged after
opening a g file. In code this can be achieved by following db_ls
and/or DB_LS_TOPS in src/libged/*.c.

After these top level objects have been identified we need to call
http://brlcad.sourceforge.net/doxygen/d3/d9b/group%5F%5Fdbio.html#ge69d8a8eb90d514e554e1b84bbb7018f[db_walk_tree]
on each of them.

5 Plot the Model using GLFW

GLFW is basically a library to use with OpenGL, to aid in the creation
of graphical windows and some other stuff. The plan is to use this
library to open up a simple window and then plot all the members of the
g file into this window.

6. Develop front end

* Develop Single window view
* Develop File Input

7. Write Functional testing test cases.
