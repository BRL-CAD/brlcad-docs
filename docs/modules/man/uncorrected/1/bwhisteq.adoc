== NAME

bwhisteq - equalize the histogram of a black and white bw file

== SYNOPSIS

*bwhisteq*[-v]_file.bw_>_file.equalized_

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*bwhisteq* automatically equalizes the histogram of a black and white xref:man:5/bw.adoc[*bw*(5)] format file. It reads the file __file.bw__ and writes a "remapped" version of it on standard output. The method used is to distribute the values of the histogram, as best as possible, in order to produce a constant average "density", while maintaining monotonicity.

The [opt]*-v* flag will output the old and new histogram values on the terminal.
