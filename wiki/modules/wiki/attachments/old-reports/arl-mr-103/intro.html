<h2>Introduction</h2> 
<p> 
The Ballistic Vulnerability Lethality Division (BVLD),
<a HREF="refer.html#1.footnote"><b>*</b></a>  formerly known
as the Vulnerability Lethality Division of the Ballistic Research
Laboratory (BRL), has been involved in geometric modeling for four
decades.  From the very beginning, geometric modeling has been
incessantly tied to the vulnerability/lethality (V/L) field. In fact,
geometric modeling in the Army was specifically developed to support V/L
assessments, and its subsequent evolution has continually been driven by
the V/L requirements.  With this direct connection to the V/L field, the
development cycle of geometric modeling at the BVLD has certainly been
atypical. Most other modern geometric modeling systems have their roots
in the mechanical drafting field, and have subsequently been tied to the
design/manufacturing environment.  Thus, to understand the development
of geometric modeling at the BVLD, one must first consider the history
of the V/L analysis field.
