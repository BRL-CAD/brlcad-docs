= BRL-CAD Wiki

Welcome to the BRL-CAD Wiki! A wiki is a type of site that allows
visitors to directly contribute to the content of a website. The
intention of the BRL-CAD Wiki is to get _everyone_ in the community
working together on providing the information that everyone needs. The
wiki is intended as a place for any documentation, tutorials, support,
examples, and other pieces of information that may be of use to
others.  All are welcome to contribute and anyone may edit most of the
wiki pages. With everyone's help, we can make this a tremendous
resource for the CAD community.

Don't be shy with your contributions. Give editing a try and be proud
of your contributions! If you make a mistake, they're very easy to
undo and you don't even need to have an account created. If you do
create an account, however, you will be credited with the contribution
in the page's history.

So be *bold* and _improve our documentation_!
