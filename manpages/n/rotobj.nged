.SH "NAME"
rotobj \- Rotates the currently edited object by z angle degrees about the z direction, y angle degrees about the y direction, and x angle degrees about the x direction in that order.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBrotobj\fP [\-i] [\fIx\-angle\fP] [\fIy\-angle\fP] [\fIz\-angle\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
Rotates the currently edited object by \fIz\fP angle degrees about the \fIz\fP
direction, \fIy\fP angle degrees about the \fIy\fP direction, and \fIx\fP angle
degrees about the \fIx\fP direction in that order. If an \fI\-i\fP option is
included, then the rotations are treated as increments to the previous
rotations. MGED must be in the matrix edit mode for this command to be
useful. The \fBp\fP command provides a similar capability for
primitive editing.
.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
The example shows the use of the \fBrotobj\fP command to rotate the
currently edited object by a given number of degrees in the \fIx\fP, \fIy\fP,
and \fIz\fP directions.
.sp
.B Example 1. Rotate the current object by a specified number of degrees in the \fIx, y,\fP and \fIz\fP directions.

.sp
Rotates the currently edited object by 25Â° about the \fIz\fP direction
from the original orientation.
