= G-VOXEL(1)

== NAME

g-voxel - generates a list of voxels from a BRL-CAD database

== SYNOPSIS

*g-voxel* [-s "_dx_ _dy_ _dz_"] [-d _n_] [-t _f_] _model.g_ _objects_...

== DESCRIPTION

The [cmd]*g-voxel* command generates a list of voxels from a .g file
(BRL-CAD database) and writes them to a voxels.txt file.

The command takes two compulsory arguments: a BRL-CAD database and at
least one geometry object (though there can be as many of the latter
as you like).

== OPTIONS

*-s "dx dy dz"*:: The voxel's size in the x, y and z axes.

*-d n*:: The level of detail used (influences the number of rays
used).

*-t f*:: The threshold upon which the voxel is considered.
