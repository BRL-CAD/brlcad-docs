= Q(nged)

== NAME

q - Ends the MGED process.

== SYNOPSIS

*q*

== DESCRIPTION

Ends the MGED process. Note that there is no write database command in
MGED. All changes are made to the database as the user performs
them. Therefore, a [cmd]*q* command will not restore the database to
its pre-edited state. This is a synonym for the [cmd]*quit* command.

== EXAMPLES

The example shows the use of the [cmd]*q* command to quit a current
MGED session.

.Quit MGED
====
[prompt]#mged># [in]`q`

The current MGED session is ended.
