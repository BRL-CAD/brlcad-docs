While there is existing ANSI C/C{pp} code for
link:wikipedia:Boundary_representation[Brep] in BRL-CAD it is
not GPU parallel. Porting it to the GPU with OpenCL should be rather
complex because much of this code is written in object oriented C{pp}.

So the first task you should make to start an OpenCL port of this is to
make a simplified version of the code which uses just ANSI C.
Alternatively you can also look into incorporating SYCL for the Brep
code. SYCL is a GPU parallel language based on C{pp} which should be
possible to interface with OpenCL.
