.SH "NAME"
handle \- Creates a BRL\-CAD .g file containing handles.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"

\fBhandle\fP [\fIoptions\fP]...
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBhandle\fP is a program to create a BRL\-CAD database of handles.
Up to twenty\-six handles of the same dimensions may be
created. \fBhandle\fP uses libwdb to create a BRL\-CAD database
file. The handles are composed of three cylinders, two tori, and two
arb8s.  This program may be run interactively or the user may specify
options on a command line.  If the user chooses to run the program
interactively, he answers the questions as the program prompts him.
Below are the options that can be used on the command line.

This program constructs a handle with the base centered
at (0, 0, 0) and the height extending in the positive z\-
direction.  The handle will be composed of 3 cylinders,
2 tori, and 2 arb8s.

Enter the name of the mged file to be created (25 char max).
        handle.g
Enter number of handles to create (26 max).

Enter the length and height of handle in mm.
        200 100
Enter the radius of the tori in mm.
        20
Enter the radius of the cylinders in mm.

Both of these examples produce the same result \- a database called
handle.g containing three handles of length 200mm, height 100mm,
radius 20mm for the rounding, and radius 10mm for the cylinders.
