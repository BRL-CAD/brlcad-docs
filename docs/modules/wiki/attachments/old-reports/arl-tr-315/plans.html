<TITLE>IGES 4.0 to BRL-CAD Translator for CSG Models</TITLE>
<H2>FUTURE PLANS</H2>
The current translator has limitations, as pointed out in the 
previous section, and is based on the current ANSI standard.  We propose 
to continue work on the IGES to BRL-CAD translator to eliminate the 
shortcomings discussed above and to extend its capabilities to include 
the latest IGES release (IGES 5.1).  This would allow <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> users 
to import solid models from virtually any CAD system that supports 
the IGES solid model transfer.  The advantage of such a capability 
should be obvious:  when solid models of military systems are available 
in a contractor's IGES-capable CAD system, it would virtually eliminate 
the duplication of effort now required to model that system in <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> 
for vulnerability studies.  Furthermore, such a capability would be 
in concert with the Department of Defense's Computer-aided Acquisition 
and Logistics Support (CALS) initiative.<P>
We believe that the two IGES CSG solids that are approximated 
by the translator can be more accurately represented by either improving 
the approximation methods or by implementing and supporting a solid 
of revolution and a solid of linear extrusion into <EM>BRL-CAD</EM>.  The introduction 
of these solids as full-fledged <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> primitives would eliminate 
any need for approximation.  Short of adding new solids, improvements 
to these approximations are possible.  For example, a circular arc 
in a solid of revolution can be accurately modeled by a portion of 
a torus, or an elliptical section of curve in a solid of linear extrusion 
can be modeled as a section of a <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> <EM>gentgc</EM>.  These 
types of improvements require considerable programming and cannot 
completely eliminate the need for a last resort approximation similar 
to the current method.  However, because both of these solid types 
are based on two-dimensional curves and have simple generation schemes, 
they are both candidates for the application of the <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> spline 
solid.  To apply a spline approach, each section of the defining curve 
would be converted to a spline curve of appropriate order.  Then the 
curves would be used to generate <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> spline surfaces, which, when 
combined into a single <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> spline solid, would create an extremely 
accurate model of the intended solid.<P>
We hope to begin development of a BRL-CAD-to-IGES translator.  
Development of a complete IGES translator package would position <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> 
for easy introduction into any established CAD oriented work place.  
The capability to transfer designs back and forth between a designer's 
commercial CAD systems and <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> would allow him access to <EM>BRL-CAD</EM>'s 
applications codes without disrupting his normal design process.  
This would also allow the designer to quickly and easily prepare a 
<EM>BRL-CAD</EM> model of his design for submission in response to an Army Request 
for Proposals (RFP) or Source Selection Evaluation Board (SSEB), 
resulting in a cost saving for the Army.  Such submissions have been 
required of Army materiel providers in the past and will likely continue 
to be required.<P>
There are two inherent difficulties in developing a BRL-CAD-to-IGES 
translator.  First, <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> has very flexible definitions for its primitive 
solids, allowing a wide range of possible shapes for the <EM>gentgc</EM>
and the <EM>genarb8</EM> solids, for example.  The IGES 
entities include special cases of these <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> solids, but are not 
general enough to handle all cases.  One approach to overcoming this 
problem is to persuade the IGES community to modify the IGES specification.  
The mechanism for accomplishing just that starts with a cooperative 
development and use of proposed, new IGES entities by two or more 
independent organizations.  After a demonstrated implementation and 
exchange of data, the proposed entities may then be submitted to the 
IGES committee for review with the intent of inclusion in the specification 
(ultimately, inclusion in the ANSI standard).  Another possible approach, 
which does not require modifying the specification, is to convert 
each unsupported (by IGES) <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> CSG primitive into a BREP object.  
This approach also appears to be a viable solution, but actually leads 
us to the second difficulty.<P>
<EM>BRL-CAD</EM> is, for all practical purposes, a hybrid CAD system.  
Although <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> primarily acts as a CSG system, it allows BREP objects 
to be intermingled among the CSG primitives.  The IGES specification 
maintains a definite separation between CSG and BREP systems and does 
not allow the two to mix.  The distinction is drawn in the definition 
of the IGES boolean tree, allowing only CSG primitives, solid instances, 
and other boolean trees as operands.  No BREP entities may occur in 
an IGES boolean tree.  Again, there are two possible solutions to 
the general incompatibility of <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> trees containing BREPs and the 
IGES trees that cannot contain BREPS.  Since IGES does not allow a 
mingling of CSG and BREP objects, one solution is to convert all the 
<EM>BRL-CAD</EM> objects to BREP objects prior to translation.  This may be 
possible in the near future as the <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> NMG technology 
is perfected.  In the near term, software can be written to tesselate 
all <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> objects to form a type of BREP object with all flat, faceted 
faces.  This approach will solve the problem, but the entire model 
would then be reduced to approximations.  However, the reader should 
be aware that many CAD systems reduce their objects to faceted BREPs 
as the final form and usually permit the level of approximation (such 
as approximating a circle by a series of straight line segments) to 
be set by the user.  Therefore, one can argue that although the resulting 
approximations might not be rigorously correct from a perfectionist's 
point of view, the faceted BREPs are usually acceptable for most applications
except for some signature applications.   Eventually, the NMG
objects are expected to be capable of supporting nonplanar surfaces 
such as spline surfaces; thus, more accurate versions of CSG objects 
could be constructed using the NMG solid.  Even so, 
the conversion of the <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> model to all NMG objects 
for the purpose of translation to IGES BREP will cause the loss of 
the original architecture of the model because only the BREP counterpart 
to the boolean tree (not the boolean tree itself) will be 
translated.  Also, translation of the  IGES BREP (formerly NMG) back 
to <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> will not produce a model that is as easily edited and modified 
as the original boolean tree form of the CSG model.  For example, 
a simple object that has a hole through it (in boolean tree form) 
is easily edited to change the size of the hole.  However, the same 
object, after conversion to BREP and translation to/from IGES, presents 
some challenge to modify the surfaces that define the object's hole 
if the user requires the hole's size to be changed.  But it should 
be noted that such a scenario would only occur if a <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> model must 
be handed off to another CAD system and modified, then for some reason 
had to be translated back into <EM>BRL-CAD</EM>.  However one could make the 
assumption that once received from the other CAD system, the existing 
object(s) need no further modification; thus, the loss of the boolean 
tree in the process is not a significant shortcoming.<P>
The second approach to this problem is, again, to influence 
the specification itself.  Here, a small modification of just the 
IGES definition of the boolean tree would allow the faithful representation 
of any <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> object in an IGES file.  The complete and unaltered 
structure of a <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> model could be preserved through translation 
to IGES and back to <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> if the IGES boolean tree allowed BREP objects 
as operands.  This is clearly the optimal approach and one that the 
authors support.<P>
