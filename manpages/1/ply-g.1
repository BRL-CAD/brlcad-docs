.SH "NAME"
ply\-g \- Stanford PLY format Translator (PLY to BRL\-CAD)
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBply\-g\fP [\-s \fIscale_factor\fP] [\-v] [\-d] \fIfile.ply\fP \fIfile.g\fP
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBply\-g\fP converts the specified \fIfile.ply\fP to a BRL\-CAD \fIfile.g\fP
file. The \fB\-v\fP option (verbose) prints much information about
what the process is doing. The \fB\-d\fP option sets a debug flag
which will cause a core dump on error. The \fB\-s\fP option specifies
a scale factor to be applied to the PLY data. By convention, PLY data
is typically in meters, so the default scale factor is 1000. The scale
factor supplied on the command line will replace the default scale
factor. So, for example, specifying a scale factor of 500 will halve
the size of the resulting BRL\-CAD model as compared to converting it
without specifying a scale factor. The \fIfile.ply\fP file is expected to
be in the Stanford PLY format (ASCII or binary).
