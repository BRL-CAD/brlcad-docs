Unless a modeler is creating a conceptually new geometry, he must work
from a variety of information sources to build a model.  In some
cases, blueprints or mechanical drawings exist.  In others, a trip to
the field is required to physically measure objects and orientations.
In still others, geometry exists in another CAD format and needs to be
converted to BRL-CAD format.  As shown in Table 1, each type of
measurement source has its own set of advantages and disadvantages,
depending on the modeler's and/or user's point of view.

| Can save time/resources by providing precise measurements with
  minimal data collection effort.  Can also suggest ways to structure
  the model (e.g., by providing wiring diagrams, subsystem schematics,
  etc.).
| Can sometimes be difficult to read.  Do not always show all needed
  measurements or views.  Are not always consistent with the actual
  objects they represent (e.g., design changes sometimes occur during
  development or manufacturing).

| Measurable objects

| Can arguably provide the best source of verifiable information by
  providing hands-on access to the actual objects being modeled.
| Can be resource and labor intensive and can be limited by the
  objects`' availability, accessibility, and measurability, resulting
  in missed measurements.

| Converted geometry

image::tutorial_series_volIII_fig22.png[]
| Can offer significant savings in data collection and/or measurement
  efforts.
| Can have missing data, unfamiliar naming schemes, and
  alternate/dissimilar geometry formats (e.g., feature-based objects,
  splines, etc.).  Can also be unsuitable for a given application
  because the original model was developed for a different purpose.

Regardless of the type information source used, there are several
simple keys to obtaining data.  These keys often require a little
extra time and effort in the early stages of the modeling process, but
they can save significantly more time and effort later on (especially
if multiple modelers are involved in the project). Several of these
keys are identified as follows:

* _Leverage all sources available:_ Although one of the previously
  mentioned sources may be the primary one from which a modeler will
  work, all available photographs, drawings, converted geometry, etc.,
  should be used together to spot-check and verify the information
  given. Sometimes schematics are mislabeled, mistakes are made while
  measuring, or geometry from other CAD packages does not convert
  properly. The only way to catch some of these errors is to compare
  them against another source.
* _Get information while it is available:_ With the many data points
  involved in building complex geometry, it is not uncommon to find
  during geometry development that not all required information was
  obtained during the data measurement/collection phase. Important
  components and/or dimensions can be overlooked, and it may be
  inconvenient or impossible (e.g., with a combat vehicle) to
  recollect, remeasure, or reconvert what is missing. Thus, a modeler
  should be as thorough as possible when obtaining data. Even if it is
  not clear whether a piece of geometry or measurement will be
  required, it can always be discarded later if not needed. Also, in
  the spirit of the carpenter's maxim, it is a good idea to "measure
  twice and cut once" and double-check measured or converted geometry
  before it is placed in a model.
* _Get total lengths and total views:_ Modelers sometimes take
  relative measurements of objects across a face without measuring the
  entire length/width of the face. Unfortunately, at the end, the
  measurements do not always add up. It is much easier to "back out"
  missed or inaccurate measurements given total
  lengths/widths. Likewise, when photographing portions of a bigger
  object (e.g., a radiator on a truck), it is a good idea to also
  capture several "bird's eye" views of encompassing objects (e.g.,
  the engine compartment or the entire truck) to help establish
  overall reference points.

[NOTE]
====
For a series of uniformly spaced objects, it is good practice to
measure the total length of the series and divide by the number of
objects.  This helps spread out any inaccuracies along the span and
prevents them from accumulating at the last object.  For example, in a
row of 20 bolts at 50-mm intervals, a measurement error of just 2 mm
between bolts could result in the last bolt being nearly 40 mm out of
position.
====
* _Record measurements as clearly and consistently as possible:_ It is
  interesting how a "scribble" that is perfectly understandable to the
  measurement-taker who is still in front of the object can become
  indecipherable when it is later viewed back in the office (when the
  object is no longer accessible). Furthermore, despite the best laid
  plans, projects and personnel can change in midstream, and the
  person(s) taking measurements may wind up having little or no
  connection to the person(s) actually interpreting those measurements
  and building the model. Therefore, all drawings and notations should
  be sufficiently clear and consistent so that someone unfamiliar with
  the object could understand and work with the recorded
  measurements. A few recommendations are given as follows:
+
** _Include meaningful titles on drawings:_ Detailed drawings and data
   can be of little value if it is unclear what the overall
   geometry/view is and how the designated piece ties into the
   completed model.
** _In general, orient drawings in orthogonal views:_ This practice
   eliminates potential problems associated with perspective and makes
   drawings easier to read and use. If other angles are desired (and
   it is not a bad idea to include at least one off-angle view with a
   few measurements to help confirm reference points), be sure to
   include azimuth/elevation and information about the orientation
   relative to the eye point and to the actual vehicle coordinate
   system. In addition, note any atypical configurations and
   orientations (e.g., a tank turret rotated in an unusual fashion to
   allow access to certain components).
** _Include offsets from other objects:_ Although these measurements
   may not actually be primary data (i.e., required inputs for MGED
   commands), they may help the modeler resolve problems or derive
   other measurements needed later. For example, when modeling a field
   of objects on a flat surface (e.g., gauges and buttons on an
   instrument panel), it is good practice not only to collect the
   distances of the objects from, say, the edges of the panel but also
   the distances relative to other objects. This information can be
   valuable when trying to troubleshoot overlaps or other problems
   encountered during the evaluation phase.
** _Clearly record small details and symbols:_ When recording
   measurements, it is important to remember that even small details
   (such as arrows, edges, centers, thicknesses, numbers, and units)
   can lead to possible confusion. Arrows too long or too short can be
   mistaken for pointing to a shape's edge instead of its center,
   hastily written numbers can be mistaken for other numbers (e.g.,
   "1" vs. "7"), unidentified inner diameters can be confused with
   outer diameters, unidentified units can be assumed to be other
   units, etc. The table below lists some standard symbols and
   abbreviations that are commonly used when recording measurements.
