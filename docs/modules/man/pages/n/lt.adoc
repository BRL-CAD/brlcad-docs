== NAME

lt - Generates a list of the child objects of a combination.

== SYNOPSIS

*lt* [_char_]

== DESCRIPTION

The [cmd]*lt* command generates a list of the children found in a combination object specified by the user.  By default it will print a curly bracket bound set of objects and their boolean flags.  If the [opt]*-c* option is specified, it will instead use the character supplied to the [opt]*-c* option as the separator in the list of objects.  In the latter mode the boolean flags will not be printed.

{u bed} {u frame} {u cab} {u suspension} {u misc} {u power.train}
....
