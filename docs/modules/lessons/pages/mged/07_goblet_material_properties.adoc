= 7. Assigning Material Properties to a Goblet
:sectnums:
:experimental:

In this lesson, you will:

* Review how to open an existing database.
* Assign colors and the plastic shader to regions of the goblet.
* Use the transparency and mirror reflectance options of the shader.
* Raytrace various forms of your goblet.

In this lesson, you will add material properties to the goblet you
created in the previous lesson.  The finished goblet should appear
similar to the one in the following example.

[[_goblet_review_opening_db]]
== Review of Opening an Existing Database

If you exited after the last lesson, open your goblet database
(goblet.g) again.  The easiest way to do this is to open the database
from the Terminal Window when first starting [app]`MGED`.  To do this,
type at the prompt:

[cmd]`mged goblet.g kbd:[Enter]`

Alternatively, you could start the [app]`MGED` program, and select
File from the menu bar and then Open.  A dialog box will appear and
ask you to enter an existing database name.  Type in goblet.g (or
select it in the directory listing) and then select Open.  The program
should tell you that the database was successfully opened and it is
using millimeters for its unit of measure.  Click on OK.

[[_drawing_goblet_graphics]]
=== Drawing the Goblet in the Graphics Window

To draw the goblet you made in the previous lesson, move the mouse
pointer to the Command Window and type at the prompt:

[cmd]`draw goblet1.c kbd:[Enter]`

A wireframe representation of the goblet should appear in the Graphics
Window.

[[_goblet_assign_colors]]
== Assigning Colors and the Plastic Shader to Regions of the Goblet

Go to the Edit menu and select Combination Editor.  To select the
various regions of the goblet you made in the last lesson, go back to
the Name box and click the button to the right of the entry box.  A
submenu will appear.  Double click on Select From All Regions.  A list
of regions created for this database will appear, including base1.r,
basin1.r, and stem1.r.  double click on base1.r to select that region.

Click on the button to the right of Color in the Combination Editor,
and a drop-down menu will appear with a list of available colors along
with a color tool that will let you create more colors.  Click on
blue.  Next, click the button to the right of the shader box.  A list
of available shaders will appear.  Click on plastic.  A new set of
options will appear.  You will use two of these options in this
lesson.  Click on Apply to assign the color blue and the plastic
shader to the goblet base.

Repeat this process to assign the color green and plastic shader to
the stem1.r region and the color yellow and plastic shader to the
basin1.r region.  When you are finished, select OK to dismiss the
Combination Editor box.

Although the changes have been made to the database, the display in
the Graphics Window doesn't reflect them yet.  So, return the mouse
pointer to the Command Window and type at the prompt:

[cmd]`B goblet1.c kbd:[Enter]`

This command clears the screen and redraws the goblet with the color
selections applied.

[[_raytracing]]
=== Raytracing the Goblet

To raytrace the goblet, go to the File menu and select Raytrace.  The
Raytrace Control Panel will appear.  Move your mouse pointer to the
button to the right of Background Color and select the white option.
To make the raytracing go faster, you can resize the Graphics Window
to make it smaller before you open the raytrace panel.  When the
window is resized, select Raytrace to start the raytrace process.

[NOTE]
====
Note: As mentioned previously, it is undesirable to have regions that
overlap.  Although having overlaps may not always affect the
raytracing process, if the model were going to be statistically
analyzed, overlaps would create problems.
====

While the goblet is raytracing, move your mouse cursor to the
Framebuffer option of the Raytrace Control Panel menu bar and select
Overlay.  When the raytrace process is finished, you should have a
goblet similar to the following example:

.The Raytraced Goblet

[[_goblet_transparency_mirror]]
== Using the Transparency and Mirror Reflectance Shader Options

The raytraced goblet looks fairly realistic, but it could be enhanced
by using other options of the Combination Editor.  When you selected
the plastic shader, a new set of options appeared, allowing you to
choose various properties or attributes of the shader.  Among the
options was Transparency.  You can adjust this property on individual
regions by entering any value between 0.0 (opaque) and 1.0
(transparent).

Just as you applied color and a shader to each of the goblet's three
regions, you can adjust the transparency of each region by (1)
selecting the region in the Combination Editor, (2) left clicking on
the box next to Transparency, and (3) entering any value between 0.0
and 1.0.

For this lesson, open the Combination Editor, click the button to the
right of the Name box, choose Select From All Regions in the drop-down
menu, and then choose the base1.r region.  Make sure plastic is the
shader selected and type in .5 to make your region semi-transparent.
Click on Apply and repeat this process for each of the other two
regions.  Then Raytrace the goblet, which should look similar to the
following:

.The Semi-Transparent Raytraced Goblet
image::mged/07_goblet_semitransparent.png[]

The colors of the semi-transparent goblet are brighter than those of
the opaque goblet because more light is allowed to penetrate the
plastic material.  You could make the goblet more realistic in
appearance by returning to the Combination Editor and adding a Mirror
Reflectance.  For each region, place your mouse cursor in the box next
to this option, click the left mouse button, and type in .45.  This
will cause about half of the available light to be reflected off the
surface of the goblet.

[[_goblet_newforms_raytrace]]
== Raytracing the New Forms of the Goblet

Click on Apply and Raytrace the design.  The new image should appear
similar to the following example:

.The Raytraced Goblet with Mirror Reflectance Added
image::mged/07_goblet_mirror.png[]

The new image is substantially different in appearance from the
original image.  Continue changing the values of transparency and
mirror reflectance to see how they impact the resulting image.

Remember that when using these options, the combined value of both
options should be less than 1.0.  The following table shows you just
some of the many possible combinations you could use:

[cols="1,1", frame="all", options="header"]
