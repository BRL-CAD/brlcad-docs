== Usage

image::Hexbolt.png[]

Run one of the commands hexbolt, allenbolt, nut, washer, cheesebolt,
without parameters. The syntax of the item specification will be
printed.

A .asc file will be produced in the current directory named according
to the item requested. Example: cheesebolt_M3x10.asc.

You can use this .asc file into two ways:

Either Import it into empty database, or Convert it into binary form
(.g format)

=== Importing into empty database

Create an empty database in mged as:

`mged database_name.g`

Then, in mged interface, go to File -> Import -> ASCII Database, and
browse the desired .asc file

=== Converting to binary form

Use following command:

`asc2g file.asc database_name.g`

and open database in mged as:

`mged database_name.g`

Whatever method you followed, run 'ls' command in mged interface to
see all objects. The name of the desired object inside the database is
filename without the .asc, for example cheesebolt_M3x10.
