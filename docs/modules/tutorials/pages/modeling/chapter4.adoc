:fn-1: footnote:[Note that we have chosen not to associate a suffix \
for objects that are unioned.  In this naming convention, objects \
without a Boolean operation suffix are understood to be unioned.]

Taking the time to map out a tree structure of an object before
building it is another important step in the modeling process,
especially if the object being constructed is elaborate, if modeling
time and resources are limited, if the work is being performed as a
team, or if the model will be passed on to someone else later.

If we consider the construction of a house, we know that builders do
not actually build houses; they build pieces of a house until the
completed structure emerges.  Furthermore, these pieces are not
usually built in a random order.  Rather, a good builder (often as
part of a team of carpenters, masons, electricians, plumbers, etc.)
follows blueprints or drawings that group the pieces into categories
based on their functionality (e.g., framing, wiring, plumbing, etc.)
or location (e.g., basement, bedroom no.  1, kitchen, etc.).

The modeling process can be thought of in much the same way.  Before
anything is built, a modeler should take on the role of an architect
and lay out a logical way to break down a potentially complicated
object into smaller, more manageable pieces.  Also, this step can
often reveal a logical building order (e.g., the drywall does not get
installed until the wiring inside the walls has been run) as well as
identify important interconnections among parts.

The following list provides some tips to achieve good model
structuring:

* _Use a top-down approach:_ It is a good idea to design the structure
using a top-down approach, beginning with the largest, most
encompassing, or most functionally significant parts/systems and
working down from there. Once again, the model's mission is
all-important here. If an armored tank is being modeled for a
ballistic analysis, the model should probably be structured so that
all the pieces connected to the turret are grouped together and,
therefore, can move together when the turret is rotated.
* _Take advantage of established organizational conventions:_ It is
wise to follow any traditional or widely used conventions that might
be available in, say, an owner's or operator's manual. If a mechanic
or user would normally expect a particular component to be part of a
suspension system, then it is wise for the modeler to structure his
model accordingly unless there is a good reason to do otherwise.
* _Use good naming practices:_ Closely associated with the idea of
using good organizational conventions to structure geometry is the
idea of using good naming conventions to name geometry. Although
naming may appear to be a trivial matter, the fact is that it is not
always easy to establish titles and schemes that are intuitive,
robust, and useful in helping the end user know where he is in a
potentially complex model.
+
There are few limitations to how files and objects can be named in
BRL-CAD (other than that each file/object name must be
unique). However, new modelers soon find that random or haphazard
naming schemes lead to inefficiency and frustration.  Thus, the
following general recommendations are provided to help modelers
efficiently organize and track what they build.
+
** Develop logical schemes, stick to them, and document them: If
logical or obvious titling schemes (such as a manufacturer's part
names or numbers) are already in place, the user should take advantage
of them, especially at the highest assembly levels of "complete" or
aggregated objects and especially when multiple modelers are
involved. This practice helps establish a logical structure (e.g., all
engine parts have a prefix of, say, eng), and many users may already
know these names.
+
Table 3 provides examples of a number of other logical naming
conventions traditionally used in BRL-CAD.  These conventions include
(1) an initial nametag to designate shape/object type or function
(i.e., sph for sphere, ant for antenna, and frf for front face); (2) a
suffix (or prefix) to designate MGED object type (i.e., .s for
primitive shapes [formerly referred to as "solids"], .r for
regions, .c for shape combinations, and .a or .g for assembly
combinations); and (3) some sort of sequential numbering scheme (i.e.,
1, 2, 3, etc.). For more information on BRL-CAD shapes and modeling
levels, see Section 5, as well as Lesson 5 and Appendix C of BRL-CAD
Tutorial Volume II (Butler et al., 2001).

[%header, cols="a,~"]
|===
| Name
| Rationale

|
....
sph.s1,
sph.r1,
sph.c1
....
| Associates the name with primitive shape type (sphere), order of
creation (1), and MGED object type (shape [.s], region [.r], or
combination [.c]).  Often used for training or testing BRL-CAD
functionality but not recommended for large, complex
modelsfootnote:[Sometimes the primitive shape tags are used to name
temporary objects that the modeler knows will be replaced or
discarded.  In this case, a more intuitive, functional name, such as
`temp`, is recommended.]

|
....
ant.s1,
ant.r1,
ant.c1
....
| Associates the name with type of function (antenna), order of
creation (1), and MGED object type (shape [.s], region [.r], or shape
combination [.c]).

|
....
frf.s1-1,
frf.s1+1,
frf.s1
....
| Associates the name with function (front face), MGED object type and
order of creation (.s1), and type of Boolean operation performed
(subtraction [âˆ’] and intersection [+]). {fn-1} This is the notation
currently used with the Build Pattern tool.

|
....
front_face.a,
right_antenna.a,
left_roadwheel.a
....
| Gives the assembly combination levels (.a) more descriptive titles
to better designate overall model composition and/or functionality for
the end user.

|
....
Driver  Main_Gun
M1A1
....
| Gives top-level assemblies human-readable descriptions of overall
composition and/or functionality.  Uses initial capitalization to show
higher tree level and disregards traditional MGED suffix.
|===
+
Note that the suffix at the end of names is particularly useful for
searching for similar items in large tree structures and for using
MGED automation features such as the Build Pattern tool and the
build_region command (see Appendices E and F).
** _Keep names short:_ Prior to BRL-CAD release 6.0, all BRL-CAD names
were limited to 16 characters. In some respects, this "limitation" was
useful, compelling new modelers to resist the common urge to name
primitives with as much detail as possible. Although the length
restriction no longer applies, it is still a good idea, especially in
large models (and with frequently used objects), to keep names of
objects as short as possible so as to reduce the amount of typing the
modeler must do and, thus, reduce the possibility for input errors. In
addition, some vulnerability analysis codes do not support names
longer than 16 characters.
+
As shown in Table 3, an exception to the practice of keeping names
short includes the names at the assembly combination level and above,
where fewer names are used and more descriptive titles can be helpful
in designating overall model composition and structure for the end
user.
** _Establish "reserve" names:_ In projects that involve multiple
modelers developing different pieces of the same geometry, it is
helpful in some cases to reserve particular name designations to avoid
possible confusion. For example, a team of modelers developing an
armored vehicle might choose to reserve the letter "h" to denote the
"nametag" for only those components associated with the hull (e.g.,
"h.s1," "h.s2," etc.). This would mean that those modelers building,
say, headlight assemblies would have to choose another designation
(e.g., "hlght.s1," "hlght.s2," etc.). This standardization can also be
helpful in establishing common terminology for later projects with the
same or similar components.
** _Avoid using certain letters and symbols:_ To avoid potential
problems associated with common UNIX notation, searching schemes, and
certain survivability, lethality, and vulnerability (SLV) analysis
codes, the following recommendations (or, in some cases, requirements)
are made regarding the use of keyboard characters in BRL-CAD names:
*** Use lowercase Arabic letters (except for the previously mentioned
initial capitalization used for top-level assemblies).
*** Use numerals without internal commas (e.g., "5000" not "5,000"). 
*** Avoid using numerals to begin a name. 
*** Do not use a space between words; use an underline or capitalize
the first character of each word (i.e., Hungarian notation).
*** Avoid using special characters. Restrict the use of "+" and """
symbols to the suffix of primitive shape combinations, and do not use
the "/".
*** Restrict the use of the period to the suffix of MGED object
types. Avoid using other punctuation (e.g., "?," "!," etc.).
*** Avoid using the lowercase letter "l" by itself (to avoid possible
confusion with the number "1").
* Include the right amount of detail: The structure should only be as
deep as needed for the application. Obviously, every part, no matter
how complex, could in theory be reduced down to the atomic or even
subatomic level, but how cost efficient and useful would this be?
More is not necessarily better. The modeler should use common sense
and consult with the end user(s) when deciding how far to break down
components and systems. Insufficient detail can diminish the model's
usefulness and reduce user confidence, and yet too much detail can
unnecessarily drain time and resources, slow down processing time of
application codes, and frustrate users who have to wade through many
parts that they do not need to get to what they do need.

[NOTE]
====
Note that it is not unusual for a modeler to select relatively
arbitrary names when shapes and parts are first made and then go back
and rename them as the model develops.  There are two commands to
rename database objects.

To rename only the database object, type the following:

....
mv oldname newname
....

Note that this command changes only the name of a particular object
and not any references to the object that may occur in combinations
throughout the database.

To change an object's name and all references to that object, the
mvall (move all) command can be used as follows:

....
mvall oldname newname
....
====
* Use location- and function-based groupings: Components should be
grouped based on simple, logical categories such as location and/or
functionality. For example, the structure of the simple radio that was
built in Lesson 16 of Volume II of the BRL-CAD Tutorial Series (Butler
et al., 2001) could be set up in several ways. Figure 4 shows a
structure based on location, and Figure 5 shows a structure based on
functionality.

+
The structuring phase, of course, gets trickier and more subjective as
the model gets more complex.  Regardless of whether the structure is
based on location, function, or something else, it is not always clear
which parts belong to which structures.  In fact, some parts are
clearly designed to interface between parts or systems, and so the
modeler must choose where he should place them in the tree structure.
A consistent treatment of these parts within the model is an important
part of the user's ability to understand and use the model.
+
It is also important to remember that the tree structure in MGED is
independent of the geometry created.  The structure is simply a tool
to help the user organize and work with the database.  Accordingly,
the tree structure can be manipulated to suit whatever needs the
user(s) may have.  Consider the example of a model of a room
containing a table and a cup on top of the table.  If one wanted to
relocate the table (along with the cup) next to a wall, one could
create a temporary combination containing the table and the cup.  This
combination could then be used to move the two objects together to
their new location.  After the objects are in position, the temporary
combination could be "pushed" (see discussion of the push command in
Section 5) and then deleted using the kill command (see Appendix A of
Volume II [Butler et al., 2001]).
