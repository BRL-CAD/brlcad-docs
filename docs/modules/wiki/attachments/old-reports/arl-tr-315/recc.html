<TITLE>IGES 4.0 to BRL-CAD Translator for CSG Models</TITLE>
<H2>RECOMMENDATIONS</H2>


<EM>BRL-CAD</EM> should be made a useful tool for every CAD user (not 
just Army or Department of Defense users) by developing a complete 
IGES compatibility package.  This package should extend beyond the 
solid modeling concerns presented in this report to include the generation 
of IGES files for any line drawing outputs <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> may produce, such 
as <EM>rthide</EM> plots or <EM>mged</EM> plots.  This 
complete package will enhance the usability and acceptability of <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> 
throughout the CAD world.<P>

The U.S. Army, and <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> in particular, should be represented 
at meetings where IGES specifications and product data exchange standards 
are discussed and developed.  Such representation has the potential 
to eliminate some of the difficulties of IGES translation for <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> 
and may avoid future problems arising from decisions similar to those 
made in the past by the IGES committee (the separation of CSG and 
BREP, and the limited cases of certain CSG primitive solids).  Private 
industry is heavily represented at these meetings, and without some 
demonstration of interest and influence by <EM>BRL-CAD</EM> users/developers, 
all decisions made by the committee will be in the best interests 
of the attendees, regardless of the consequences they may hold for 
<EM>BRL-CAD</EM>.<P>

As IGES is developing to maturity, another candidate for product 
data exchange is still in its infancy.  Product Data Exchange Using 
STEP (PDES) is a more comprehensive approach under development by 
an international organization (which includes the IGES committee as 
one part).  The STEP portion of the PDES acronym represents the Standard 
for the Exchange of Product Model Data, which is the actual candidate 
for an international standard, while PDES is the U.S. effort supporting 
STEP.  A satisfactory discussion of PDES is beyond the scope of this 
report, but the reader should be aware that PDES's potential use is 
considerably more than a mere replacement of IGES.  PDES encompasses 
an order of magnitude greater scope and application than IGES.  Whereas 
IGES is concerned with the product definition of an 
object (part, component, system), PDES's objective is to address the 
complete range of an object's product data (i.e., 
data relevant to the product's complete life cycle).  As an analogy, 
comparing IGES to PDES is like comparing nroff to 
the UNIX operating system in terms of total scope and functionality.<P>

Work on PDES dates back to the mid-1980s, but PDES has not demonstrated 
a capability that compares to IGES's capability when IGES was a little 
more than a half-decade old.  That statement is not a criticism of 
PDES, but merely accentuates the enormous task that is the PDES effort.  
It is predicted that possibly in ten years, PDES will be the method 
of choice for exchanging product definition data, including solid 
models.  If PDES is eventually accepted as a standard by the International 
Standards Organization (ISO), then it is definitely in the best interests 
of the ARL to be actively participating in the development of this 
new specification.  Many of the same people who developed IGES are 
heavily involved in PDES, and the ARL should be involved to insure 
that the development of specifications do not exclude capabilities 
demonstrated by <EM>BRL-CAD</EM>.<P>
