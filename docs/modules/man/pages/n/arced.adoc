= ARCED(nged)

== NAME

arced - Provides a means for directly editing transformation matrices
of Boolean tree leaves.

== SYNOPSIS

*arced* {_comb/memb_} {_anim_command_}

== DESCRIPTION

The objects in a BRL-CAD model are stored as Boolean combinations of
primitive shapes and/or other combinations. These combinations are
stored as Boolean trees, with each leaf of the tree including a
corresponding transformation matrix. The [cmd]*arced* command provides
a means for directly editing these matrices. The first argument to the
[cmd]*arced* command must identify the combination and which member's
matrix is to be edited. The _comb/memb_ argument indicates that member
_memb_ of combination _comb_ has the matrix to be edited. The
remainder of the [cmd]*arced* command line consists of an animation
command to be applied to that matrix. The available animation commands
are:

[cmd]*matrix rarc <xlate|rot> matrix elements*::
Replace the members matrix with the given matrix. 

[cmd]*matrix lmul <xlate|rot> matrix elements*::
Left multiply the members matrix with the given matrix. 

[cmd]*matrix rmul <xlate|rot> matrix elements*::
Right multiply the members matrix with the given matrix. 

== EXAMPLES

.Rotate body/head 45 degrees about Z axis
====
[prompt]#mged># [ui]`arced body/head matrix rot 0 0 45`

Rotates member head (in combination body) about the _z_ axis through a
45Â° angle. By default, the [cmd]*matrix* commands expect a list of 16
matrix elements to define a matrix. The _xlate_ option may be used
along with three translation distances in the _x_, _y_, and _z_
directions (in mm) as a shorthand notation for a matrix that is pure
translation. Similarly, the _rot_ option along with rotation angles
(degrees) about the _x_, _y_, and _z_ axes may be used as shorthand
for a matrix that is pure rotation.
