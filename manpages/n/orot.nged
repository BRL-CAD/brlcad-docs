performed, in order: \fIxdeg\fP about the \fIx\fP axis, then \fIydeg\fP about the
\fIy\fP axis, and finally \fIzdeg\fP about the \fIz\fP axis. If the \fI\-i\fP flag is
given, then the angles are interpreted as increments to the last
object rotation. The \fBrotobj\fP command is a synonym for \fIorot.\fP
