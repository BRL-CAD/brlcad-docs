== NAME

plot3-fb - display 3-D UNIX plot on a framebuffer

== SYNOPSIS

*plot3-fb* [-id] [-O|o] [-t _line_thickness_] [-F _framebuffer_] [-S|s _squaresize_] [-W|w _width_] [-N|n _height_] [<] _file.plot3_

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*plot3-fb* displays a BRL extended three dimensional UNIX plot
file on a framebuffer. The environment variable [var]`FB_FILE` is used
to select the display device (see
xref:man:1/brlcad.adoc[*brlcad*(1)]); if this variable is not set, the
default device for your system will be used. Alternatively, the
framebuffer may be explicitly specified by using the [opt]*-F*
flag. By default, the display size is assumed to be 512x512
pixels. The [opt]*-S*, [opt]*-W*, and [opt]*-N* (or [opt]*-s*,
[opt]*-w*, and [opt]*-n*) flags allow different screen sizes to
be set.  The plotting space will fill the given screen dimensions.  No
attempt is made at present to preserve aspect.

The [opt]*-O* (or [opt]*-o*) flag is for overlay mode, where the
current framebuffer image will be left in the background. The
[opt]*-i* flag causes the rasterized image to be plotted immediately,
rather than buffering up rasterized data into bands.  While useful for
quick feedback on small plots, this mode is generally more expensive
in CPU time. The [opt]*-d* flag outputs a very verbose debugging
stream to standard error listing every UNIX plot command and the
corresponding framebuffer coordinates. The [opt]*-t* flag causes all
lines to be thickened perpendicular to their length, to the given
number of pixels. This is especially useful when making images for
recording on videotape, as single pixel lines are difficult to
resolve. The thickening will be reduced so that a line will never be
wider than it is long.

If _file.plot3_ is not specified, the plot commands are read from
standard input.

Note that 3-D UNIX plot is a superset of the standard UNIX plot
format, thus this program can display normal plot files as well.
