Exploded view diagrams allow for an organized way to view the components
of a complex model. Recent research has outlined automated approaches to
generating these view of geometry:

The project idea is to make use of BRL-CAD's raytracing functionality to
find ways to break geometric models into exploded view configurations
(animation of the expansion is not necessary, simply generating the
final configuration.)

* Familiarity with C/C{pp}
