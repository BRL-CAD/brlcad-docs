== NAME

mater - Assigns shader parameters, RGB color, and inheritance to an
    existing combination.
    

== SYNOPSIS

*mater* [-s] {_combination_} [shader_parameters [RGB [inheritance]]]
*mater* {-d} {source}
*mater* {-d} {clear}
*mater* {-d} {import} [-v] {_file.density_}
*mater* {-d} {export} {_file.density_}
*mater* {-d} {validate} {_file.density_}
*mater* {-d} {get} [--tol <tolerance>] [--id _[[>|<][=]id]|[id pattern]_] [--density _[[>|<][=]val_] [--name _pattern_] [_pattern_]
*mater* {-d} {set} {_id,density,name_}
*mater* {-d} {map} {--ids-from-names} {-d _density_file_} {-m _map_file_} [_density_file_] [_map_file_]
*mater* {-d} {map} {--names-from-ids} [_density_file_]

== DESCRIPTION

In its default mode, [cmd]*mater* assigns shader parameters, RGB color, and inheritance to an existing combination. The information may be included on the command line; otherwise the user will be prompted for it. Some available shaders are: 

* bump -- bump maps. 
* bwtexture -- black and white texture maps. 
* camo -- camouflage. 
* checker -- checkerboard design. 
* cloud -- 2D Geoffrey Gardner style cloud texture map. 
* envmap -- environment mapping. 
* fakestar -- a fake star pattern. 
* fbmbump -- fbm noise applied to surface normal. 
* fbmcolor -- fbm noise applied to color. 
* fire -- flames simulated with turbulence noise. 
* glass -- Phong shader with values set to simulate glass. 
* gravel -- turbulence noise applied to color and surface normal. 
* light -- light source. 
* marble -- marble texture. 
* mirror -- Phong shader with values set to simulate mirror. 
* plastic -- Phong shader with values set to simulate plastic. 
* rtrans -- random transparency. 
* scloud -- 3D cloud shader. 
* spm -- spherical texture maps. 
* stack -- allows stacking of shaders. 
* stxt -- shape texture mapping. 
* texture -- full color texture mapping. 
* turbump -- turbulence noise applied to surface normals. 
* turcolor -- turbulence noise applied to color. 
* wood -- wood texture.

== DENSITY DATABASE MANIPULATION

In the event the .g file has an internal density database defined (or the user wishes to define such a database) the [cmd]*mater* command provides a number of options. 

To import a density file into the .g file, use the [cmd]*import* subcommand.  By default this will update and append to an existing database if present.  If the [opt]*-v* is added, a validation will be performed on the specified density file before import. To completely replace any pre-existing definitions in the database, first run the [cmd]*clear* subcommand.  To write out the current density definitions to a file use the [cmd]*export* subcommand. 

To simply test a density file for validity without attempting to import it, use the [cmd]*validate* subcommand.  The [cmd]*source* subcommand will report where commands using density information will draw their data from - if data is present in the .g file the current database name will be returned, otherwise the system path to the currently active .density file will be returned. 

For manipulation of subsets of the data, the [cmd]*get* and [cmd]*set* subcommands are provided. [cmd]*get* will return either one or a set of tuples matching the provided patterns. For density matching a tolerance may be specified to allow for approximate matches. The glob style of pattern matching is supported. 

[[_matermappingdesc]]
== DENSITY DATABASE MANIPULATION - MAPPING MODE

The [cmd]*map* mode of operation uses density information (either from a file or from the current database) to syncronize the *material_id* and *material_name* properties of objects.  The [opt]*--ids-from-names* mode will use *material_name* properties, perform a lookup on the density database to find a corresponding id number, and update the **material_id**.  If an optional mapping file is supplied, the name lookup will also find id assignments based on the name equivalencies specified by the map. 

For situations where a file has *material_id* attributes but no names, the [opt]*--names-from-ids* option will use density information to assign *material_name* attributes to those objects whose *material_id* values are present.  It will also update existing *material_name* values. 

== EXAMPLES

The example shows the use of the [cmd]*mater* command to assign shader parameters, color, and inheritance to a region. 

.Assigning shader parameters, color, and inheritance to a region.
====

[prompt]#mged>#[ui]`mater region1 "plastic {tr 0.5 re 0.2}" 210 100 100 0`::
Sets _region1_ to use the plastic shader with 50% transparency, 20% 			reflectivity, a base color of (210 100 100), and inheritance set to 0. 
====

.Importing Density Data
====

[prompt]#mged>#[ui]`mater -d import /home/user/.density`::
After this operation, the density valued defined in /home/user/.density are now stored in the .g file. 
====

.Viewing Density Data
====

[prompt]#mged>#[ui]`mater -d get --name \*Rubber\*`::
Lists all density entries with a material name containing "Rubber". 
====

.Names from IDs
====

[prompt]#mged>#[ui]`mater -d map --names-from-ids /home/user/.density`::
Assigns *material_name* names from a density file assuming existing *material_id* attributes. 
====

.IDs from Names
====

[prompt]#mged>#[ui]`mater -d map --ids-from-names /home/user/.density /home/user/mapping_file`::
Assigning or updating *material_id* attributes based on *material_name* attribute values, density file names, and mapping file associations.
