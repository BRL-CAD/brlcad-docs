== NAME

g-shell-rect - Produce triangulated shell from BRL-CAD model

== SYNOPSIS

*[cmd]#g-shell-rect#* [-a [rep]_rpp_args_][-R [rep]_edge_tol_][-p [rep]_plotfile_][-X [rep]_lvl_][-d [rep]_debug_level_][-b][-n][-i [rep]_initial_ray_dir_][-g [rep]_cell_size_]-o [rep]_brlcad_output_file_[rep]_database.g_[rep]_object(s)_

== DESCRIPTION

*[cmd]#g-shell-rect#* converts the specified __objects(s)__ from a BRL-CAD model __database.g__ to a single NMG solid using raytracing. Rays are fired in a uniform grid. The direction for the first set of rays is chosen by calculating the presented area of the bounding box of the __object(s)__ and selecting the direction with the largest area. The user may override this by specifying a desired initial ray direction using the *[opt]#-i#* option (see below). The initial shell is constructed using only the first and last intersections with the __object(s)__. This will typically result in some rather large faces with normals at right angles to the ray direction. Unless the *[opt]#-n#* option is specified, these faces are then subdivided (according to the __cell_size__) and additional rays fired from the other two directions are used to refine their shape. The resulting NMG solid will be named __shell__ and will be written to the specified __brlcad_output_file__.

The following command line options are recognized:

*[opt]#-g#* _cell_size_::
Specify the dimensions (in millimeters) of the grid spacing.  The default is 50mm.

*[opt]#-i#* _initial_ray_dir_::
Specify the initial ray direction.  Valid values are X, Y, or Z. The best results are usually obtained by raytracing in the direction that produces the most hits first.

*[opt]#-d#* _debug_level_::
Set the debugging level.  Higher values produce more debugging information.

*[opt]#-n#* ::
Suppresses the refinement stage (firing rays from the secondary and tertiary axis directions).

*[opt]#-b#* ::
Output a BOT rather than an NMG.

*[opt]#-a#* _rpp_args_::
Add an RPP for refining.

*[opt]#-R#* _edge_tol_::
Supply edge tolerance.

*[opt]#-p#* _plotfile_::
Supply plotfile for plot edge breaking.

*[opt]#-X#* _lvl_::
Supply NMG debug flags.

*[opt]#-o#* _output.g_::
Specifies the name of the BRL-CAD geometry file to create.
