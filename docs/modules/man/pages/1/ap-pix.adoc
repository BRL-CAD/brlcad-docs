== NAME

ap-pix - convert Applicon files to pix files

== SYNOPSIS

*ap-pix* [-v] _file.ap_ > _file.pix_

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*ap-pix* converts an Applicon drum plotter image file into a
xref:man:5/pix.adoc[*pix*(5)] file.

The Applicon file is assumed to consist of a number lines each 3456
bits long; the resulting _pix_ file thus has scanlines of 3456 pixels.
