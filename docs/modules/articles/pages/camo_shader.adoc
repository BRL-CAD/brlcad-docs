= Camouflage shader

== Introduction

The "camo" shader creates a pseudo-random tri-color camouflage pattern
on the object using a fractal noise pattern.  This is a procedural
shader based upon a fractal noise function known as fractional
brownian motion or fBm.

The fractal noise function produces a pseudo-random number in the
range `[-1.0 ... 1.0]` from the 3-space coordinates of a point in the
bounding volume of the region.  This noise value is used to determine
the color of the object at the given location.

|color 1

|nv < thresh1 and nv < thresh2
|color 2

|nv > thresh2

The fractal pattern has infinite resolution.  As a result, the borders
of the color splashes never become pixelated, no mater how close the
eyepoint is to the surface.

Lacunarity :: The grid on which the noise function is built is scaled
by this value for each successive octave of noise which will be
combined to produce the final result.

Octaves :: The number of times the noise grid will be scaled and
recombined to produce the final noise function

Size, Vscale :: If *size* is set it is used as a scalar which defines
the size of the noise grid on the object.  So if t2=0.5 and size=5mm
then splotches of color3 would tend to be no larger than 5-10mm.  If
non-uniform scaling is required, Vscale can specify the grid size in
X, Y and Z.

Delta :: This specifies a translation in noise space for the origin of
region space.  Since the origin of noise space is reflected 8 ways, it
is undesirable to have that portion of noise space overlap with region
space.

== Limitations

Because of the continuous nature of the fractal noise space, it is
impossible to get a splash of color1 directly adjacent to a splash of
color3.
