== NAME

vars - With no arguments, will list all the MGED variables and their
values.   

== SYNOPSIS

*vars* [_variable_=_value_]

== DESCRIPTION

With no arguments, will list all the MGED variables and their values. If a _variable=value_ string is included on the command line, then that _value_ is assigned to the specified __variable__.  Note that no spaces are allowed around the =. The available _variables_ are as follows: 

* autosize -- if nonzero, then MGED will set the view size whenever it draws to an empty display. 
* rateknobs -- if nonzero, then the knobs and sliders act as rate adjustments; otherwise, they act as absolute adjustments. 
* sliders -- if nonzero, the sliders are displayed. 
* faceplate -- if nonzero, the MGED faceplate is displayed. 
* orig_gui -- if nonzero, the viewing menu is displayed. 
* linewidth -- indicates how wide to draw lines. 
* linestyle -- set line style of wireframe shapes. Currently not being used. 
* hot_key -- the X11 keysym definition for the key to toggle the _send_key_ value. The default is 0xFFC6 (65478 decimal), which is the F9 key. The keysym values are defined in the X11 file named __keysymdef.h__. 
* context -- if nonzero (the default), then primitive editing parameters entered via the [cmd]*p* command will be applied to the edited shape in the context of the combination tree above it in the displayed hierarchy. This means, for example, a translation applied to a shape will translate the shape to some point such that when the transformation matrices for that path are applied, the edited shape will appear at the specified location. If _context_ is set to zero, then the primitive edit operations will be applied directly to the edited shape. This means that a translation to a specific point may result in the edited shape being drawn at a point different from that specified (due to transformations in the _combination_ tree above it). Note that this only affects primitive edit operations that use the _p_ command. 
* dlist -- if nonzero, use display lists. 
* use_air -- if nonzero, use air while raytracing. 
* listen -- if nonzero, listen for connections to MGEDs built-in fbserv.
* port -- port for the built-in fbserv to use. 
* fb -- if nonzero, then framebuffer is active. 
* fb_all -- if nonzero, use entire geometry window for the framebuffer; otherwise, use only the rectangular area. 
* fb_overlay -- if nonzero, overlay framebuffer image over geometry; otherwise, draw geometry over the framebuffer image. 
* mouse_behavior -- see the following list of mouse behaviors: 
** c -- fire ray for combination edit selection. 
** d -- default behavior (i.e., as found in classic MGED). 
** m -- fire ray for matrix edit selection. 
** p -- paint rectangular area. 
** q -- fire query rays. 
** r -- raytrace rectangular area. 
** s -- fire ray for primitive edit selection. 
** z -- zoom rectangular area. 
* coords -- see the following list of coordinate systems to use for transformations: 
** m -- model coordinates. 
** v -- view coordinates. 
** o -- object coordinates. 
* rotate_about -- see the following list of centers of rotation: 
** v -- view center. 
** e -- eye. 
** m -- model origin. 
** k -- keypoint. 
* transform -- see the following list of things to transform: 
** a -- transform the angle distance cursor if active; otherwise same as v. 
** e -- apply transformations to the edit. 
** v -- apply transformations to the view. 
* predictor -- if nonzero, the predictor frame will be displayed. 
* predictor_advance -- the number of seconds into the future to advance the predictor frame. 
* predictor_length -- not currently used. 
* perspective -- if greater than zero, this is the perspective angle in degrees; otherwise, perspective is turned off. 
* perspective_mode -- if nonzero, turn perspective on; otherwise, turn it off. 
* toggle_perspective -- used to toggle among the four canned perspective angles (i.e., 30, 45, 60, and 90). 
* nmg_eu_dist -- when the _-u_ option to the [cmd]*ev* command is used, the NMG edgeuses are drawn this distance (mm) away from the actual edge. 
* eye_sep_dist -- if greater than zero, this is the eye separation distance (mm) for stereo viewing; otherwise, stereo is off. 
* union_op -- not currently used. 
* intersection_op -- not currently used. 
* difference_op -- not currently used. 


== EXAMPLES

The example shows the use of the [cmd]*vars* command with an argument. 

.Display the sliders.
