.SH "NAME"
lint \- Detect and report problems with subsets or all of a .g database.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBlint\fP [\-h] [\-C] [\-M] [\-I] [\-F "filters"] [\fIObjectName\fP]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The \(aqlint\(aq command analyzes the currently open geometry database (or a
subset of that database if object names are supplied as arguments) and
searches for a variety of problems know to sometimes occur.  By
default all defect types are searched for \- if one or more of the
options enabling a search for a specific type of problem are supplied,
only those searches will be performed.
.SH "OPTIONS"
.sp
\fB\-h\fP
.RS 4
Print help message.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-C\fP, \fB\-\-cyclic\fP
.RS 4
Check for full paths that are cyclic \- i.e. a
situation where a high level object incorporates in its definition
tree a reference to itself. Such definitions are always considered
invalid, and are sometimes problematic for tools working with geometry
hierarchy.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-M\fP, \fB\-\-missing\fP
.RS 4
Check for references to objects or files that are
missing (not present in the database or on the file system.)
Primarily this is a check for comb objects referring to missing
objects, but it will also check for and report invalid object and file
references in extrude and dsp primitives.
.RE
.sp
\fB\-I\fP, \fB\-\-invalid\fP
.RS 4
Check for shapes in the database that do not
satisfy one or more properties required for them to be valid
definitions, where correcting the problem requires a change to the
object\(cqs definition.  (As of this writing the only implemented check
is for BoT object solidity, but many more are possible and planned.)
(Objects invalid due to missing objects are potentially valid without
the necessity of changing the object\(cqs own definition \- e.g. the
missing object/file can be added. That category of error can be
searched for with the \fB\-M\fP check.)
.RE
.sp
\fB\-F\fP, \fB\-\-filter\fP
.RS 4
Apply search command style filters to the set of
objects to be tested.  Allows, (for example) a user to test only brep
objects and not bot objects or only objects matching a particular name
pattern.  Does not impact the checks for missing or cylic geometry \-
the underlying search mechanism assumes inputs do not have those
particular categories of problem and thus can\(cqt be reliably applied in
those cases.
