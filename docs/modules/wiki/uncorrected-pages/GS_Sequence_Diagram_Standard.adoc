= Notes on Sequence Diagrams

* Sequence show how link:GS_Actors_Standard[Actors] and
Classes/Objects interact with eachother over time.
* Extremely useful for identifying potential areas to impliment
concurrency.
* Extremely useful for identifying programing concept flaws.

= Sequence Diagram Legend

*Actors and Classes/objects are listed across the top

* Time progresses downward.
* A thin line under an object shows that the object exists, but is not
active.
* A thick line under an object shows that the object exists and is
active.
* A solid line indicates a call to a function of another class/object.
* A dashed line indicates the return value (Not usually shown on
initial sequence diagrams, but can be)
* A solid arrowhead indicates a blocking call.
* A winged arrowhead indicates a non-blocking call.
* Text ontop of an arrow shows the name of the function being called.
This is not manditory on initial Sequence Diagrams, but is required
once the design matures.
* An 'alt' block is the equivilent of an If/If-Else/If-ElseIf-Else
statement.
* A 'Loop' block is the equivlient of a while loop.
* A 'par' block is a parallel block.
* Any test in a [] set is called a guard, or a condition that is to
be tested. In the event of an 'alt' block, its the
if([condition]). Etc.
