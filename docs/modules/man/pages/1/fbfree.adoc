= FBFREE(1)

== NAME

fbfree - free any frame buffer resources

== SYNOPSIS

*fbfree* [-F _framebuffer_]

== DESCRIPTION

[cmd]*fbfree* is used to free any resources associated with a frame
buffer. Its most common use is to close down an
xref:man:1/fbserv.adoc[*fbserv*(1)] process and its associated frame
buffer. This command can also be used to free any shared memory
segments on, e.g., Sun and SGI frame buffers.

This program simply calls the fb_free() routine in
xref:man:3/libfb.adoc[*libfb*(3)].
