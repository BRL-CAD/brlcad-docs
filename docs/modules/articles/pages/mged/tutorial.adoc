== Modeling With CSG

In BRL-CAD objects are constructed using a technique known as
"Combinatorial Solid Geometry" or "Constructive Solid Geometry" or
simply "CSG" In the CSG approach to modeling This technique involves
creating objects by combining primitive shapes together to form
complex objects.  The primitive shapes are called "solids".  Each one
occupies a volume of three dimensional space.  BRL-CAD currently has
many primitive solid types.  These include:

These primitives can be combined using boolean operators to create
complex shapes.  The three boolean operations supported are union,
difference (or subtraction), and intersection.  Any number of
primitives may be combined to produce a shape.  The union (u) of two
solids is defined as the volume in either of the solids.  The
difference (-) of two solids is the volume of the first solid which is
not in the volume of the second solid.  The intersection (+) of two
solids is the volume that is contained in both solids.

image::mged/bool.gif[]

The result of performing a set of boolean operations is a new shape.
In BRL-CAD this new shape is known as a "combination".  This is
frequently abbreviated as "comb".  A "comb" can be further combined
with other shapes to create still more complex shapes.  For example,
the shape of a simple cup might be created by subtracting a cylinder
from a slightly larger cylinder.  From this "comb" shape, the shape
of a mug could be created by adding a handle.  The handle might be
composed of an elliptical torus with the part of the torus that would
be inside the cup removed.  Logically this is:

----
Cup = Outside - Inside
Handle = Ring - Outside
Mug = Cup union Handle
----

image::mged/cup_and_mug_small.gif[]

In this way the shape of objects are built up from components.

When the desired shape of an object is attained, a special combination
called a "region" is created.  A "region" represents an actual
material component of the model.  It represents an item which is made
from a homogeneous type of material.  In the example above two
combinations are created: Cup and Handle.  These two are brought
together to form an object (Mug) which is made of a single material
(such as ceramic or bone china).  Material properties such as color,
texture, transparency, reflectivity, etc.  are assigned to regions.

The model is built up as a tree-like structure known as a Directed
Acyclic Graph or DAG.  It is permissible for a node to be referenced
by different parts of the model.  In the mug example, the solid
"Outside" is a part of two different combinations: Cup and Handle.  In
this example the graph of the mug object looks like this:

----
			  Torus
			 /
		Handle (-)
	       /	 \
	Mug (u)		  Cylinder
	       \	 /
		Cup -- (-)
			 \
			  Insides
----

It is possible to refer to combinations and regions multiple times as
well.  For example, if a modeler were trying to create a cupboard
containing three separate identical mugs, he might create a structure
as follows:

----
	 Mug 1			    Ring
        /     \			   /
       /       \	 Handle (-)
     (u)        \       /	   \
Mugs (u)- Mug 2--Mug (u)	    Outside
     (u)        /       \	   /
       \       /	 Cup -- (-)
        \     /			   \
	 Mug 3			    Inside
----

Users familiar with other CAD software may prefer to think of the
"region" as a "part".  Combinations containing of "regions" may be
thought of as "assemblies".

[[_starting_mged]]
== Starting MGED

The program for editing BRL-CAD geometry is called [cmd]`mged`.

All the geometry for a particular model or application is generally
stored in a single file called a database.  Each database may contain
many different objects.  By convention, the files containing BRL-CAD
geometry have an extension of `.g`.

Before starting mged the user should assure that the X-Windows DISPLAY
environment variable has been properly set.  This indicates where
applications should display the windows they create.

We use the following conventions for denoting text: 

----
	Text typed by the user
	Text output by the program
----

To edit or create a geometry file, the user starts the mged program
from the shell by giving the command:

`[prompt]#%# [cmd]#mged -c cup.g#`

The filename is required.  Unlike many programs which allow the user
to create a new document or database in memory, mged always keeps
everything on disk.  After each user command, the contents of the disk
file are brought up to date.  By doing this, the amount of work lost
in the event of a system crash is minimized.

When mged is started, it prints out the release number and date of
compilation.  When multiple versions of mged are installed on a
machine, this allows the user to verify that the proper version is
being started.

If the file specified does not exist when mged is started, it will
stop and ask if the user wishes to create a new database:

[subs="quotes"]
----
   [prompt]#%# [cmd]#mged -c cup.g#
   [output]#BRL-CAD Release 4.5   Graphics Editor (MGED)

       bparker@vapor.arl.mil:/m/cad/.mged.6d

   cup.g: No such file or directory#
   [prompt]#Create new database (y|n)[n]?#
----

At this point pressing the "y" key followed by a return will create
the new database.  Any other (non-y) keys (followed by a return) will
cause mged to quit without creating the database.

[subs="quotes"]
----
   [prompt]#%# [cmd]#mged -c cup.g#
   [output]#BRL-CAD Release 4.5   Graphics Editor (MGED)

   [output]#Creating new database "cup.g"
   Untitled MGED Database (units=mm)#
   [prompt]#attach (nu|X|ogl|glx)[nu]?#
----

At this point, mged is asking what type of geometry display window you
would like.  The default is always "nu" for Null or "no geometry
display".  If you are creating geometry, it is desirable to be able to
see it.  The common choices are:

----

At this point you should have a window that looks something like this:

image::mged/faceplate_sm.gif[]

When the MGED program has a display window or device attached, it
displays a border around the region of the screen being used along
with some ancillary status information.  Together, this information is
termed the editor "faceplate".

In the upper left corner of the window is a small enclosed area which
is used to display the current editor state.  The current editor state
indicates whether objects are selected for editing and what modeling
operations are allowed.

Underneath the state display is a zone in which three "pop-up" menus
may appear.  The top menu is termed the "button menu," as it contains
menu items which duplicate many functions which were originally
available via an external button box peripheral.  Having these
frequently used functions available on a pop-up menu can greatly
decrease the number of times that the user needs to remove his hand
from the pointing device (either mouse or tablet puck) to reach for
the buttons.

Below is an example of the faceplate and first level menu.

image::mged/faceplate_menu_sm.gif[]

The second menu is used primarily for the various editing states, at
which time it contains all the editing operations which are generic
across all objects (scaling, rotation, and translation).  The third
menu contains selections for object-specific editing operations.  The
choices on these menus are detailed below.

Running across the entire bottom of the faceplate is a thin
rectangular display area which holds two lines of text.  The first
line always contains a numeric display of the model-space coordinates
of the center of the view and the current size of the viewing cube,
both of which are displayed in the currently selected editing units.
The first line also contains the current rotation rates.

The second line has several uses, depending on editor mode.  In
various editing states this second line will contain certain path
selection information.  When the angle/distance cursor function is
activated, the second line will be used to display the current
settings of the cursor.

All numeric interaction between the user and the editor are in terms
of user-selected display units.  The user may select from millimeters,
centimeters, meters, inches, and feet, and the currently active
display units are noted in the first display line.  One important
implementation detail is that all numeric values are stored in the
database in millimeters.  When MGED interacts with the user, it
converts values from the database into the units selected by the user
before displaying them.  Likewise, values that the user enters are
converted to millimeters before being written to the database.

[[_the_screen_coordinate_system]]
== The Screen Coordinate System

Objects drawn on the screen are clipped in X, Y, and Z, to the size
indicated on the first status line.  This creates a conceptual
"viewing cube".  Only objects inside this cube are visible.  This
feature allows objects within the cube to be seen, without cluttering
the display with objects which are within view in X and Y, but quite
far away in the Z direction.  This is especially useful when the
display is zoomed in on a small portion of the geometry.  On some
displays Z axis clipping can be selectively enabled and disabled as a
viewing aid.

The MGED editor uses the standard right-handed screen coordinate
system shown in the figure below.

image::mged/coord-axes.gif[]

The Z axis is perpendicular to the screen and the positive Z direction
is out of the screen towards the viewer.  The directions of positive
(+) and negative (-) axis rotations are also indicated.  For these
rotations, the "Right Hand Rule" applies: Point the thumb of the right
hand along the direction of +X axis and the other fingers will
describe the sense of positive rotation.

[[_creating_geometry]]
== Creating Geometry: The Cup

Let's look at the commands needed to build the cup geometry described
in the first section.  The following MGED editing session contains all
the commands needed to create the mug.  Each command will be explained
below.

----

The first step in preparing a new database is to provide a title which
describes the contents of the database.  This is an important
opportunity to describe the contents and purpose of the database.
Setting the title is done with the title command in MGED.

`mged> Title MGED Tutorial Geometry`

When the database is first created, the default editing units are set
to millimeters.  For this example, we want to specify the dimensions
of the object in inches.  To arrange this, the units command

`mged> units in`

Now we can create our first solid.  There are two techniques for
creating geometry in MGED.  The commands for these two techniques are
make and in (for "insert").  For precision modeling the in command
offers the greatest control over the definition of the solid.  This is
the approach we will use.

The "in" command can take all of its arguments on the command line, or
it will prompt you for any missing portions.  Remembering what
parameters need to be specified for each solid can be difficult at
best.  All that you really need to enter is the command name.  Mged
will prompt you for the rest of the parameters.

In the first example above we specify the name of the solid we are
creating ("outside.s") and the type of solid to create ("rcc"). Then
mged prompts for the remaining arguments (vertex, height vector, and
radius):

----
   mged> in outside.s rcc
   Enter X, Y, Z of vertex: 0 0 0
   Enter X, Y, Z of height (H) vector: 0 0 3.5
   Enter radius: 1.75
----

For the solid "inside.s" we specify all the parameters on the command
line, so mged does not prompt us for additional arguments.  In the
case of the solid "ring.s" we specify some, but not all of the
parameters, and mged prompts us for the missing ones:

----
   mged> in inside.s rcc 0 0 0.25 0 0 3.5 1.5
   42 vectors in 0.006435 sec
   mged> in ring.s eto 0 2.5 1.75 1 0 0
   Enter X, Y, Z, of vector C: .6 0 0
   Enter radius of revolution, r: 1.45
   Enter elliptical semi-minor axis, d: 0.2
   2479 vectors in 0.087375 sec
----

As a minimal example, if we wanted to create a sphere called "ball.s"
we could simply type the "in" command and let mged prompt us for
everything else:

----
   mged> in
   Enter name of solid: ball.s
   Enter solid type:  sph
   Enter X, Y, Z of vertex:  0 0 0
   Enter radius:  3
   51 vectors in 0.117187 sec
----

The three boolean operators supported are union, subtraction and
intersection.  These operations are denoted by the operators u, - and
+ respectively.  Mged uses these in a sort of prefix notation.  In
this notation the union operator has higher precedence than either
subtraction or intersection.  Hence the following boolean sequence

----
	(A union B) subtract C

is written as

	u A - C u B - C
----

The comb command creates a boolean combination.  In our example we use
this to create the shape of the outside of the cup called "cup.s"
Reading the command above that creates cup.c, we note that cup.c is
formed from the union of the volume defined by the solid "outside.s"
and the subtraction of the volume defined by the solid "inside.s".

The r command creates a "region".  It is just like creating a
combination, but the results are a volume of one logical material
type.

Assigning material properties is done with the mater or shader
command.  Here we define which shader should be used when rendering
the object, and the parameters for the shader.  The simplest shader is
the "plastic" shader which uses a Phong lighting model.  For our mug
this will be fine.  We specify the plastic shader and set the color to
a shade of green.

----
   mged> mater mug.r
   Shader =
   Shader?  ('del' to delete, CR to skip) plastic
   Color = (No color specified)
   Color R G B (0..255)? ('del' to delete, CR to skip) 32 128 32
   Inherit = 0:  lower nodes (towards leaves) override
   Inheritance (0|1)? (CR to skip) 0
----

The Inheritance option should be left 0.  This option will be
discussed later.  Once we have created our geometry, it would be nice
to look at the wireframe from a variety of angles.  By clicking on the
button menu box a set of options is displayed.  The buttons labeled
"35,25", "Top", "Right", "Front", and "45,45" offer a set of standard
views.

It is possible to raytrace the current view from within mged.  But to
do so we need a place to display the image.  We start up a framebuffer
server (number 1) to accommodate this:

`mged> exec fbserv 1 /dev/sgip &`

This runs the "fbserv" program which will maintain a framebuffer
window for us.  Now we are ready to raytrace an image.  First we'll
clear the geometry window of all the primitives and combinations and
regions we've created.  Then we display the region we want to raytrace
with the "draw" command.  Finally, we'll select a nice viewing angle
of azimuth 35 elevation 25 with the "ae" command.

----
   mged> Z
   mged> draw mug.r
   mged> ae 35 25
----

Now we are ready to raytrace an image.  The "rt" command starts the
raytracer on the geometry.  We must tell it where we want the pixels
displayed with the "-F" option, and the size of the image with the -s
option:

`mged> rt -F:1 -s 512`

The rt program prints a variety of information when it runs:

----

If all goes well, you will get an image of a green mug on a black
background.

image::mged/mug_green.gif[]

Now let's improve on our basic cup.  The lip of this cup looks a
little too squared off.  To fix this, we'll add a rounded top to
the lip.  To do this we create a circular torus solid positioned at
exactly the top of the cup.  Then we can add it to the combination
"cup.c".

Now we have a unique condition.  The solid rim.s was added to the list
of objects being displayed when it was created.  However, now it is
also a part of mug.r (via cup.c).  If we raytrace the current view we
will have 2 copies of this solid.  The raytracer will complain that
they overlap.  The best way to fix this is to clear the display,
redisplay the new, complete object, and then raytrace.  The "Z"
command clears all objects from the display.  Then we can redisplay
the objects we want to raytrace with the "draw" command.

----
   mged> Z
   mged> draw mug.r
----

Since this is a frequent operation (clear the display list and draw
something new) there is a shortcut:

----
   mged> B mug.r
----

The "B" is not very easy to remember (one suggested mnemonic is
"blast"), but it is quite useful.  Now we are ready to raytrace again.

== Editing Solids 

So far we've focused on creating primitive solids and combinations.
Now let's look at ways of altering and deleting things that already
exist.  We'll continue with our example mug geometry.  There are a
number of changes that need to be made to make it more realistic.

The handle for the mug is a little awkward.  It sticks out too far
from the side of the mug, and it is too wide.

The bottom is perfectly flat.  Any imperfection in the table top would
cause it to wobble.  The inside bottom corner is too sharp.  We need
to create a "fillet" at the seam between side and bottom.
