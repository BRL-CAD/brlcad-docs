= GSNet Msg Description

== Header

The header of the GSNet Msg contains the information necessary for
quickly determining authenticity, type and length. Geometry Service's
network library, libNetwork, has a header byte layout that looks like
this:

|===
|  |  |

| *Element*
| *Length*
| *Value*

| MsgType
| int16 (2 bytes)
|

| MessageLength
| int32 (4 bytes)
| Does *NOT* include the type or length, so is packet size - 6

| MessageUUID
| link:GSNet_String[String (Variable bytes)]
|

| HasRegardingUUID
| Boolean (1 byte)
|

| RegardingMessageUUID
| link:GSNet_String[String (Variable bytes)]
|
|===

* *MsgType:* 2 byte integer value that tells what type of message
this is.
* *MessageUUID:* Standard UUID for this message. Currently stored as
a string.
* *HasRegardingUUID:* Boolean flag that indicates whether there is a
Regarding UUID or not.
* *RegardingMessageUUID:* Standard UUID that indicates this NetMsg
is a response to another NetMsg.

== Data

'''

The Data load of a NetMsg is, obivously, the important and unique part.
Data Loads can be as small as zero (in the case of a TypeOnlyMsg) or
many kilobytes long.

Here is a list of link:NetMsgTypes[NetMsg types] and here is a
list of link:Common_NetMsg_Exchanges[Common NetMsg Exchanges].
