.SH "NAME"
fbed \- frame buffer editor
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBfbed\fP [\-pH]
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
\fBfbed\fP is an editor for frame buffer images, designed to
facilitate the manipulation of existing images for the preparation of
presentation quality graphics.  Although it does have the potential to
generate fairly complex images, it is meant mainly for touching up
existing images; adding titles, captions or other labels; cutting and
pasting of one or more images; and reducing images or portions
thereof. \fBfbed\fP uses the frame buffer library
\fBlibfb\fP(3) and therefore is available on all
graphics devices which are supported by this package.  On start up,
the program always attempts to open the default frame buffer.  This
device is specified by the frame buffer library, and is configurable
on a per system basis.  Often the user will want to override this
default by setting the environment variable \f(CRFB_FILE\fP (see
\fBbrlcad\fP(1)). The \fB\-H\fP option is for
editing 1024x1024 or high resolution (\fIHIRES\fP) images; the default is
low resolution, 512x512 (\fILORES\fP). The frame buffer\(cqs state can be
toggled back and forth between \f(CRHIRES\fP and \f(CRLORES\fP at any time during
execution of the program.
.sp
The \fB\-p\fP option turns on the "pad" flag.
.sp
\fBfbed\fP allows function\-to\-key bindings and macro definition
facilities in a fashion similar to some of the more versatile
EMACS\-style screen editors, such as \fBjove\fP(1).
.SS "Cursor Movement"
.sp
When \fBfbed\fP is running on a graphics device, a cursor will appear
on the screen. The position of the cursor points to the \fIcurrent
pixel\fP.
.SS "Terminal Display"
.sp
When run interactively, with the standard input attached to a
terminal, the screen will be divided into 5 areas: the top line will
be referred to as the \fIoption line\fP; the second line from the top will
be called the \fIheader line\fP; the bottom line of the screen will be the
\fIstatus line\fP; the second line from the bottom will by the \fIprompt
line\fP; and the rest of the screen is devoted to scrolling text
output. The \fIoption line\fP contains the current \fIpixel\fP color and
\fIpaint\fP color, \fIstride\fP and \fIbrush size\fP. Colors are expressed as a
combination of red, green, and blue intensity values; ranging from 0
to 255.  The \fIpixel\fP color refers to the \fIcurrent pixel\fP which is
pointed to by the cursor on the graphics device. \fIpaint\fP color is used
by functions that require a color rather than prompting for it every
time. The \fIstride\fP indicates how many pixels the cursor will move per
keystroke during key\-activated cursor movement.  Finally, \fIbrush size\fP
refers to the size of the square of pixels filled in by the
\fIput\-pixel\fP command. The \fIheader line\fP is displayed in reversed video,
and contains the program name and version number as well as the
current cursor position. The \fIprompt line\fP is where the user will see
prompts when the program requires information. The \fIstatus line\fP is
used to print messages, indicating to the user that an operation is
on\-going.
.SS "Modes of Input"
.sp
The user interface consists of a list of provided commands, referred
to as \fIfunctions\fP; and user\-defined commands, called \fImacros\fP. In
general, every key\-stroke will immediately be processed (this is often
popularly called \fIraw\fP mode input) and therefore, virtually every
function or macro is executed by striking a particular key, without
having to enter it by hitting \f(CRRETURN\fP. The key that activates a
particular function or macro is said to be \fIbound\fP to that operation.
.sp
Many of the functions will require the user to type some additional
information or \fIarguments\fP, and a prompt will appear in the lower left
corner of the screen. When responding to such prompts, the style of
input resembles that of Bourne and C Shell derivatives with in\-line
EMACS\-style editing. This means that the following \fIcontrol\fP keys have
special meaning:

When attempting to fetch the last input typed, the user should keep in
mind that this is specific to the particular function which is doing
the prompting and to that particular question being asked by that
function. Most of the prompts are intended to appear self\-explanatory,
but there are a couple of exceptions. The \fIexecute\-function\-or\-macro\fP
function places the user in the prompted mode of input for the purpose
of typing the name of the command. This is useful when the key binding
is not known off\-hand or a key binding does not exist, but the name of
the command is known (or can be guessed at). In any case, it is an
alternative to key\-activated execution of a function or macro. When
entering the prompted mode of command input, a \(aq:\(aq will appear in the
bottom left of the terminal screen and the terminal\(cqs cursor will
appear just ahead of it. Now, all of the above control key functions
are in force, and command\-completion is implemented as well. At any
time while typing the name of the function or macro, the space bar may
be hit to attempt command\-completion. The command\-completion logic
will look at what has been typed, and if it represents the beginning
of an existing function or macro, the remainder of that name which can
be uniquely matched will appear. If there is no match, the portion of
the name that has been typed that does not match will be deleted,
starting at the end and working back. In other words, the user only
needs to type the unambiguous root of the name. If the user has done
so, hitting the space bar will show the complete name, or hitting the
\f(CRRETURN\fP key will enter the command. If the \f(CRRETURN\fP key is struck,
and there is no unique match, nothing will happen. Whenever the user
is prompted for the name of a function or macro, and there are other
functions that prompt for this specifically, then command\-completion
is provided. Another atypical prompt is generated by the
\fIargument\-count\fP function, and looks like \fIM\-\fP. The cursor will appear
right after the hyphen, and the user is expected to type a number
(sequence of digits). This sequence of digits must be terminated by a
command key\-stroke. This number represents an count of how many times
to execute the command bound to that final key\-stroke. If a digit is
bound to a function or macro, it will not be recognized by the
\fIargument\-count\fP function.
.SS "User\-defined Macros and Key Bindings"
.sp
The user may define a macro as a series of key\-strokes. This is
initiated by executing the \fIstart\-macro\-definition\fP function. The
message "Remembering..." will appear on the \fIstatus line\fP, and the
user then types the key\-strokes which will represent the macro
definition. These key\-strokes will be executed as the macro is
defined. To end the macro definition, the user executes the
\fIstop\-macro\-definition\fP function. Sometimes, the user will want to
defer specifying the answers to prompts when defining a macro, so that
he can supply the information when the macro is executed. In order to
incorporate this into his macro, the user would type a \(aq@\(aq at the
prompt. This will cause the function to fail while the user is
defining the macro, but this will hopefully not cause any fatal
side\-effects. Immediately after defining the macro, or before defining
another, the user should enable its execution by giving it a name with
the \fIname\-keyboard\-macro\fP function. If the user desires, he may bind
it to a key with the \fIbind\-macro\-to\-key\fP function, or it may be
executed by name only.
.sp
Another way of customizing the frame buffer editor is to change the
binding of keys to functions. This is done by executing either
\fIbind\-key\-to\-name\fP or \fIbind\-key\-to\-key\fP. The former will bind a key to
either a function or macro by specifying its name, and the latter
refers to the function or macro by a key that is currently bound
to it.
.sp
Both key bindings and macro definitions can be saved in a file using
\fIwrite\-macros\-to\-file\fP and read back with
\fIread\-macros\-from\-file\fP. Whenever the frame buffer editor starts up,
it looks for a file called \fI.fbed_macros\fP in the user\(cqs home
directory, and reads it if it exists. A list of functions and macros
and their key bindings can be obtained by executing the
\fIprint\-bindings\fP function which is bound to \(aq?\(aq by default. Here is
the standard listing:

.SH "HINTS"
.sp
This program may require a little practice; be sure to save a copy of
the input files until you are confident. If you are using the program
for the first time, you should start by listing the menu, finding the
command for saving your image, and using such command if you don\(cqt
already have a copy.

.sp
This program is currently under development.
.sp
It is known that aborting the execution of the certain functions will
at times display bogus messages like "I seem to have lost my
bindings."
.sp
There is currently a hard limit of 10 times \f(CRBUFSIZ\fP (defined in
\fIstdio.h\fP) for the length of the macro startup file.
