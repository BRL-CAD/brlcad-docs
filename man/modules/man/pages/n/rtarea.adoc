== NAME

rtarea - Calculate exposed, presented and centers of surface areas
(MGED Command)

== SYNOPSIS

*rtarea* [_options_]...

== DESCRIPTION

For displayed objects, the _rtarea_ command calculates the exposed,
presented and centers of surface areas. The summary output includes
details for individual regions, assemblies (combinations that contain
regions), and summarized totals. By default current display azimuth
and elevation are used for computations. Summary units are current
MGED editing units.

The _exposed_ area corresponds to what a human observer would see
looking at the object(s) in question, if all the objects were
non-transparent. For example, say rays were cast towards two cubes,
each one of which is a region, one in front of the other, grouped into
an assembly, with the ray direction pointed into the page:

....
|----------------| Rear Cube
|                |
|                |
|        |--------------| Front Cube
|        |       |      |
|        |       |      |
|--------|-------|      |
	 |              |
	 |              |
	 |--------------|
....

The exposed area of the Front Cube corresponds to the total area of
the sheet, since it is not occluded by any other object:

....
|----------------| Rear Cube
|                |
|                |
|        |--------------| Front Cube
|        |**************|
|        |**************|
|--------|**************|
	 |**************|
	 |**************|
	 |--------------|
....

The Rear Cube, on the other hand, IS occluded by the Front Cube and
would thus report only a fraction of its area as exposed:

....
|----------------| Rear Cube
|****************|
|****************|
|********|--------------| Front Cube
|********|       |      |
|********|       |      |
|--------|-------|      |
	 |              |
	 |              |
	 |--------------|
....

An object that combines both of these sheets would thus report as its
exposed area the sum of the exposed areas of the individual sheets:

....
|----------------| Rear Cube
|****************|
|****************|
|****************|------| Front Cube
|***********************|
|***********************|
|--------|**************|
	 |**************|
	 |**************|
	 |--------------|
....

_Presented_ area, unlike exposed area, does not take occlusion into
account. It is the equivalent of taking each object and considering it
in isolation. So for the previous case of two sheets of metal, the
Front Cube would report the same area:

....
|----------------| Rear Cube
|                |
|                |
|        |--------------| Front Cube
|        |**************|
|        |**************|
|--------|**************|
	 |**************|
	 |**************|
	 |--------------|
....

The Rear Cube, on the other hand, ALSO reports its full area:

....
|----------------| Rear Cube
|****************|
|****************|
|****************-------| Front Cube
|****************|      |
|****************|      |
|--------|-------|      |
	 |              |
	 |              |
	 |--------------|
....

When reporting the presented area of the group, there is a subtle
point - rtarea does not count area covered by multiple regions
multiple times when totaling the presented area. So for the group
containing both cubes, the presented area is NOT the cumulative area
of both regions' presented areas but the area of the union of those
two areas. In this case, that works out to be the same as the exposed
area.

....
|----------------| Rear Cube
|****************|
|****************|
|****************|------| Front Cube
|***********************|
|***********************|
|--------|**************|
	 |**************|
	 |**************|
	 |--------------|
....

It should be noted that rtarea only counts surfaces with a surface
normal that has a component looking back in the direction of the ray.
So, for example, a cube with only one face looking "back toward" the
ray will not report area from other faces as "presented", since their
surface normals will indicate they are not surfaces being presented to
the ray.

WARNING: _Rtarea_ may not correctly report area or center when
instancing is done at the group level. Using [cmd]*xpush* can be a
workaround for this problem.

== OPTIONS

*-s#*:: Specifies the number of rays to fire in the X and Y directions
on a square grid. The default size is 512 pixels.

*-a#*:: Selects auto-sizing, and gives the view azimuth in
degrees. Used with -e option. The default is the current display
azimuth.

*-e#*:: Selects auto-sizing, and gives the view elevation in
degrees. Used with -a option. The default is the current display
elevation.

*-g#*:: Is used to set the grid cell width, in
millimeters. Ordinarily, the cell width is computed by dividing the
view size by the number of pixels of width, so this option need not be
used. To obtain exactly 1 inch ray spacing, specify -g25.4.  If the
grid cell width is specified and the grid cell height is not
specified, the grid cell height defaults to be the same as the width.

*-G#*:: Sets the grid cell height, in millimeters.

*-J#*:: The "jitter" flag is a bit vector. If one (-J1), it randomizes
the point from which each ray is fired by +/- one half of the pixel
size. If two (-J2), it shifts the origin of the output frame once for
each frame. The shift is along a circular path in the plane of the
frame, with a period of ten seconds, and a radius of +/- 1/4 pixel
width. If three (-J3), it performs both operations.

*-U#*:: Sets the "use_air" value. The default is 1, meaning "air"
solids (i.e. regions with a non-zero aircode attribute value) will be
retained. If this value is zero, "air" solids in the model will be
ignored.

*-c "set cc=1"*:: Compute and report area centers. The default is off.

*-X#*:: Turns on the rt(1) program debugging flags. See raytrace.h for
the meaning of these bits.

*-x#*:: Sets the librt(3) debug flags to the given hexadecimal bit
vector. See raytrace.h for the bit definitions.
