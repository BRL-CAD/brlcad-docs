.SH "NAME"
arced \- Provides a means for directly editing transformation matrices of Boolean tree leaves.
.SH "SYNOPSIS"
.sp
\fBarced\fP {\fIcomb/memb\fP} {\fIanim_command\fP}
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
.sp
The objects in a BRL\-CAD model are stored as Boolean combinations of
primitive shapes and/or other combinations. These combinations are
stored as Boolean trees, with each leaf of the tree including a
corresponding transformation matrix. The \fBarced\fP command provides
a means for directly editing these matrices. The first argument to the
\fBarced\fP command must identify the combination and which member\(cqs
matrix is to be edited. The \fIcomb/memb\fP argument indicates that member
\fImemb\fP of combination \fIcomb\fP has the matrix to be edited. The
remainder of the \fBarced\fP command line consists of an animation
command to be applied to that matrix. The available animation commands
are:
.sp
\fBmatrix rarc <xlate|rot> matrix elements\fP
.RS 4
Replace the members matrix with the given matrix.
.RE
.sp
\fBmatrix lmul <xlate|rot> matrix elements\fP
.RS 4
Left multiply the members matrix with the given matrix.
.RE
.sp
\fBmatrix rmul <xlate|rot> matrix elements\fP
.RS 4
Right multiply the members matrix with the given matrix.

.SH "EXAMPLES"
.sp
.B Example 1. Rotate body/head 45 degrees about Z axis
.br
.RS 4
.sp
mged> \f(CRarced body/head matrix rot 0 0 45\fP
.sp
Rotates member head (in combination body) about the \fIz\fP axis through a
45Â° angle. By default, the \fBmatrix\fP commands expect a list of 16
matrix elements to define a matrix. The \fIxlate\fP option may be used
along with three translation distances in the \fIx\fP, \fIy\fP, and \fIz\fP
directions (in mm) as a shorthand notation for a matrix that is pure
translation. Similarly, the \fIrot\fP option along with rotation angles
(degrees) about the \fIx\fP, \fIy\fP, and \fIz\fP axes may be used as shorthand
for a matrix that is pure rotation.
