= Modeling King

Now itâ€™s time to model the king. It is comparatively easier than the
above pieces. To begin modeling, create a new database, type in the
command prompt:

`[in]#opendb king.r#` kbd:[ENTER]

You have your Command and Graphics ready after confirming in the
dialog box.

If you look at all the chess pieces, you see that the base and body of
almost all the pieces are the same and they only differ in the head
area. To make the base and the body, type in:

`[in]#in base.rcc rcc 0 0 0 0 0 0.7 2.25#` kbd:[ENTER]


`[in]#in body.trc trc 0 0 0.7 0 0 2.2 2.25 0.85#` kbd:[ENTER]


`[in]#in curve.tor tor 0 0 2.9 0 0 1 3.2 2.4#` kbd:[ENTER]


To make a cylinder for the neck, type:

`[in]#in neck.rcc rcc 0 0 2.9 0 0 0.5 1.4#` kbd:[ENTER]

As described in the above pieces, the shape `neck.rcc` must be placed
at the top of `body.trc`. Once we have made the base, body, and curve
we get something like this:

When we look closely at the end product, the head can be divided into
three parts, the head bottom, the middle section, and the tiny top
section. All of these are *trc*. To make the bottom part of the head,
type:

`[in]#in headbottom.trc trc 0 0 3.4 0 0 1.5 0.8 1.4#` kbd:[ENTER]

Here the base radius of the `headbottom.trc` is equal to the top
radius of `body.trc`.

Since the top radius of `headbottom.trc` should be equal to the base
radius of the `headmid.trc`. Therefore, to make the mid part, type:

`[in]#in headmid.trc trc 0 0 4.9 0 0 0.3 1.4 1.1#` kbd:[ENTER]

Now to make the top part this head, type:

`[in]#in headtop.trc trc 0 0 5.2 0 0 0.6 0.3 0.5#` kbd:[ENTER]

After this, your Graphics Window looks like:

You have all your shapes now. It is time to make a region of it:

`[in]#r king.r u base.rcc u body.trc - curve.tor u neck.rcc u
headbottom.trc u headmid.trc u headtop.trc#` kbd:[ENTER]

Now, assign material properties using the following command:

`[in]#mater king.r plastic 0 0 0 0#` kbd:[ENTER]

Before raytracing, use the blast command as follow:

`[in]#B king.r#` kbd:[ENTER]

To achieve the target design, change the view to *Front* from the
*View* menu. Now raytrace your design from the *File* menu.
