== NAME

screengrab - 
      Save the current MGED display visual or framebuffer contents to an image file.
    

== SYNOPSIS

*screengrab* [_-F_] [_--format fmt_] {_image_file_}

== DESCRIPTION

Generates an image file containing either the current application display manager's visual representation of the current scene or (when the [opt]*-F* option is specified) the contents of the current application embedded framebuffer. 

The output format of the image file will be deduced from the filename, but if the caller wishes to ensure a specific format the [opt]*--format* may be used. 

== EXAMPLES

.Write a PNG image file of the MGED framebuffer contents.
====
[prompt]#mged>#[ui]`screengrab -F fb.png`
