= Introduction to BRL-CAD
:sectnums:
:experimental:

This document aims at introducing you to BRL-CAD through a basic
step-by-step tutorial. In this tutorial, you will model a chess set in
BRL-CAD and by the end, we hope this tutorial changes the way you look
at shapes. Brace yourself, you are about to enter the amazing world of
3D computer-aided design (CAD) modeling.


== What is modeling

A model of an object can be used to understand how it works, to
visualize, analyze, print or simply used to study the object. Now, CAD
modeling is the act of creating this computer representation with
specific dimensions. BRL-CAD is used to model 3D objects that have all
the physical characteristics of an object.


== Intro to BRL-CAD

BRL-CAD is a powerful 3D solid modeling system. This software has been
in use for a wide range of military, educational, and industrial
applications. CAD software like BRL-CAD requires a lot of practice to
master, but this tutorial will help you get started. As you work
through the tutorial, you will see commands taking shape into
something you want to model.

To get to know more about BRL-CAD, its origin, history, you can check
out the http://brlcad.org/wiki/FAQ[BRL-CAD FAQs].

Let’s begin this journey and get BRL-CAD installed in your system.
Downloading BRL-CAD is just a few clicks:

* Go to https://brlcad.org/ and click on the *Download* link at the
top left corner.
* On the next page, click on the folder for your computer. For Windows
or Mac operating systems, select *BRL-CAD for Windows* or *BRL-CAD for
Mac OS X* respectively.
* Download and run the installer. Follow the installation prompts.

For a more detailed installation walkthrough, see this

== Intro to MGED

BRL-CAD has many applications, but in this tutorial you will work in
an editor called “MGED”. The Multi-Device Geometry Editor (MGED) is
the main way to create geometry in BRL-CAD.

Launching MGED on Windows or Mac OS X :: Double-click the application
icon for MGED.

Launching MGED on Linux :: Open a terminal (tty) prompt, using
kbd:[Ctrl+Alt+T] (if you are on Ubuntu). Type [cmd]`mged` in the terminal
prompt and then press kbd:[ENTER].
+
NOTE: There is a chance that you might get an error when you type
[cmd]`mged` in the command prompt stating #mged is not recognized as a
command# or #mged command not found#. In that case, you need to
specify the full path to where you installed BRL-CAD.

Two new windows should pop up: the _MGED Command Window_ and the _MGED
Graphics Window_ (sometimes called the _Geometry Window_). The former
is for entering commands and the later for displaying the output.

.MGED Command Window

.MGED Graphics Window

|===

Both windows are empty at the moment.

While there are ways to do nearly everything in MGED via the graphical
user interface menus, this tutorial is going to introduce you to
modeling by way of MGED commands.

== Opening a database:

Before you start modeling anything in MGED, create a database.  Move
your mouse over or click anywhere on the _Command Window_ to make it
active and type [cmd]`opendb` followed by the name of the database
with the [path]`.g` extension:

[subs="+quotes,+macros"]
....
[cmd]#opendb# [path]#demo.g# kbd:[ENTER]
....

If the database with name [path]`demo.g` doesn’t already exist or you
are creating a new one, the _Command Window_ confirms if you want to
create a new database as shown below:

Type kbd:[y] and press kbd:[ENTER].

If [path]`demo.g` already exists, the database opens up.


== Modeling in BRL-CAD

Let’s understand in brief how modeling in BRL-CAD works:

* {blank}
+
Using primitive shapes :: Now, what are primitive shapes? A primitive
shape is a basic 3D object whose parameters can be changed without
changing the shape’s type. For example, a sphere is a basic 3D shape
and is one of over two dozen primitives available in BRL-CAD. Click
https://brl-cad.github.io/gallery/media/large/diagrams/primitives.png[here^]
to see the primitives used in BRL-CAD.

* {blank}
+
Employing basic Boolean operations on the shapes :: Not every shape we
model is a primitive shape; so, to get the required output we apply
basic boolean operations of _union_, _subtraction_, and _intersection_
on these shapes. For example, a hollow cylinder can be made by
subtracting a cylinder from another larger cylinder.

Once you are comfortable with a few of the commands, it will get
easier to model anything to everything.


== The modeling target:

In this tutorial, you are going to model a complete chess set. We’re
going to base our 3D modeling on a 2D design by Arthur Shlain.

Seeing your chess pieces and chess board taking shape with each
command is going to be thrilling. First, you will model all the unique
chess pieces which include a pawn, rook, king, queen, knight, and
bishop:

After modeling the chess pieces, you will move on to the chessboard
which will look like this:
